"Most eyes with nearsightedness are healthy, but a small number of people with severe myopia develop a form of retinal degeneration.",0
" Simultaneously, there is measurable alpha cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia in the early overt stage of the disease, leading to expanded alpha cell mass.",1
" This, together with failing beta cell insulin secretion, begins to account for rising glucagon levels that contribute to hyperglycemia.",1
 Some researchers believe glucagon dysregulation to be the primary cause of early stage hyperglycemia.,1
 Leading hypotheses for the cause of postprandial hyperglucagonemia suggest that exogenous insulin therapy is inadequate to replace the lost intraislet signalling to alpha cells previously mediated by beta cell-derived pulsatile insulin secretion.,1
 Under this working hypothesis intensive insulin therapy has attempted to mimic natural insulin secretion profiles in exogenous insulin infusion therapies.,1
"Hypoglycemic glucagon impairment Hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetics is often a result of over-administered insulin therapy, though being in a fasting state, exercising without proper adjustment of insulin, sleep, and alcohol can also contribute.",1
 The normal counter regulatory responses to hypoglycemia are impaired in type 1 diabetics.,1
" Glucagon secretion is normally increased upon falling glucose levels, but normal glucagon response to hypoglycemia is blunted when measured in type 1 diabetics and compared to healthy individuals experiencing an equal insulin-induced hypoglycemic trigger.",1
" Beta cell glucose sensing and subsequent suppression of administered insulin secretion is absent, leading to islet hyperinsulinemia which inhibits glucagon release.",1
"Autonomic inputs to alpha cells are much more important for glucagon stimulation in the moderate to severe ranges of hypoglycemia, yet the autonomic response is blunted in a number of ways.",1
" Recurrent hypoglycemia leads to metabolic adjustments in the glucose sensing areas of the brain, shifting the threshold for counter regulatory activation of the sympathetic nervous system to lower glucose concentration.",1
 This is known as hypoglycemic unawareness.,1
 Subsequent hypoglycemia is met with impairment in sending of counter regulatory signals to the islets and adrenal cortex.,1
" This accounts for the lack of glucagon stimulation and epinephrine release that would normally stimulate and enhance glucose release and production from the liver, rescuing the diabetic from severe hypoglycemia, coma, and death.",1
" Numerous hypotheses have been produced in the search for a cellular mechanism of hypoglycemic unawareness, and a consensus has yet to be reached.",1
" The major hypotheses are summarized in the following table In addition, autoimmune diabetes is characterized by a loss of islet specific sympathetic innervation.",1
" This loss constitutes an 80-90% reduction of islet sympathetic nerve endings, happens early in the progression of the disease, and is persistent though the life of the patient.",1
 It is linked to the autoimmune aspect of type 1 diabetics and fails to occur in type 2 diabetics.,1
" Early in the autoimmune event, the axon pruning is activated in islet sympathetic nerves.",1
" Increased BDNF and ROS that result from insulitis and beta cell death stimulate the p75 neurotrophin receptor p75NTR, which acts to prune off axons.",1
" Axons are normally protected from pruning by activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase A Trk A receptors by NGF, which in islets is primarily produced by beta cells.",1
 Progressive autoimmune beta cell destruction therefore causes both the activation of pruning factors and the loss of protective factors to the islet sympathetic nerves.,1
" This unique form of neuropathy is a hallmark of type 1 diabetes, and plays a part in the loss of glucagon rescue of severe hypoglycemia.",1
"Diagnosis Diabetes is characterized by recurrent or persistent hyperglycemia, and is diagnosed by demonstrating any one of the following Fasting plasma glucose level at or above 7.",1
" at early stages of an immune reaction to them but no overt diabetes, and treated with niacinamide vitamin B3, had less than half the diabetes onset incidence in a seven-year time span than did the general population, and an even lower incidence relative to those with antibodies as above, but who received no niacinamide.",1
People with type 1 diabetes and undiagnosed celiac disease have worse glycaemic control and a higher prevalence of nephropathy and retinopathy.,1
" Gluten-free diet, when performed strictly, improves diabetes symptoms and appears to have a protective effect against developing long-term complications.",1
" Nevertheless, dietary management of both these diseases is challenging and these patients have poor compliance of the diet.",1
"Management Diabetes is often managed by a number of health care providers including a dietitian, nurse educator, eye doctor, endocrinologist, and podiatrist.",1
 Lifestyle There is limited evidence for the usefulness of routine use of low-carbohydrate dieting for people with type 1 diabetes.,1
" Although for certain individuals it may be feasible to follow a low-carbohydrate regime combined with carefully-managed insulin dosing, this is hard to maintain and there are concerns about possible adverse health effects caused by the diet.",1
" In general, people with type 1 diabetes are advised to follow an individualized eating plan rather than a pre-decided one.",1
There are camps for children to teach them how and when to use or monitor their insulin without parental help.,1
" As psychological stress may have a negative effect on diabetes, a number of measures have been recommended including exercising, taking up a new hobby, or joining a charity, among others.",1
 Insulin Injections of insulin ‚ via subcutaneous injection using either a syringe or using an insulin pump ‚ are necessary for those living with type 1 diabetes because it cannot be treated by diet and exercise alone.,1
" Insulin dosage is adjusted taking into account food intake, blood glucose levels and physical activity.",1
 Untreated type 1 diabetes can commonly lead to diabetic ketoacidosis which can result in death.,1
 Diabetic ketoacidosis can cause cerebral edema accumulation of liquid in the brain.,1
" This is a life-threatening issue and children are at a higher risk for cerebral edema than adults, causing ketoacidosis to be the most common cause of death in pediatric diabetes.",1
"Treatment of diabetes focuses on lowering blood sugar or glucose BG to the near normal range, approximately 80‚ 140 mg/dl 4.",1
 Mild cases are self-treated by eating or drinking something high in sugar.,1
 Severe cases can lead to unconsciousness and are treated with intravenous glucose or injections with glucagon.,1
" Continuous glucose monitors can alert patients to the presence of dangerously high or low blood sugar levels, but continuous glucose monitors still have a margin of error.",1
As of 2016 an artificial pancreas looks promising with safety issues still being studied.,1
 In 2018 they were deemed to be relatively safe.,1
" Pancreas transplantation In some cases, a pancreas transplant can restore proper glucose regulation.",1
" However, the surgery and accompanying immunosuppression required may be more dangerous than continued insulin replacement therapy, so is generally only used with or some time after a kidney transplant.",1
" One reason for this is that introducing a new kidney requires taking immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, which allows the introduction of a new pancreas to a person with diabetes without any additional immunosuppressive therapy.",1
" However, pancreas transplants alone may be beneficial in people with extremely labile type 1 diabetes.",1
 Islet cell transplantation Islet cell transplantation may be an option for some people with type 1 diabetes that is not well controlled with insulin.,1
" Difficulties include finding donors that are compatible, getting the new islets to survive, and the side effects from the medications used to prevent rejection.",1
" Success rates, defined as not needing insulin at 3 years following the procedure, occurred in 44% of people on registry from 2010.",1
" In the United States, as of 2016, it is considered an experimental treatment.",1
"Complications Complications of poorly managed type 1 diabetes may include cardiovascular disease, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic retinopathy, among others.",1
" However, cardiovascular disease as well as neuropathy may have an autoimmune basis, as well.",1
 Women with type 1 DM have a 40% higher risk of death as compared to men with type 1 DM.,1
 The life expectancy of an individual with type 1 diabetes is 11 years less for men and 13 years less for women.,1
" People with type 1 diabetes are higher risk for other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.",1
 Urinary tract infection People with diabetes show an increased rate of urinary tract infection.,1
 The reason is bladder dysfunction is more common in people with diabetes than people without diabetes due to diabetes nephropathy.,1
" When present, nephropathy can cause a decrease in bladder sensation, which in turn, can cause increased residual urine, a risk factor for urinary tract infections.",1
" Sexual dysfunction Sexual dysfunction in people with diabetes is often a result of physical factors such as nerve damage and poor circulation, and psychological factors such as stress and/or depression caused by the demands of the disease.",1
"Males The most common sexual issues in males with diabetes are problems with erections and ejaculation With diabetes, blood vessels supplying the penis‚ erectile tissue can get hard and narrow, preventing the adequate blood supply needed for a firm erection.",1
" The nerve damage caused by poor blood glucose control can also cause ejaculate to go into the bladder instead of through the penis during ejaculation, called retrograde ejaculation.",1
" When this happens, semen leaves the body in the urine.",1
 Another cause of erectile dysfunction is reactive oxygen species created as a result of the disease.,1
 Antioxidants can be used to help combat this.,1
"Females Sexual problems are common in women who have diabetes, including reduced sensation in the genitals, dryness, difficulty/inability to orgasm, pain during sex, and decreased libido.",1
" Diabetes sometimes decreases estrogen levels in females, which can affect vaginal lubrication.",1
 Less is known about the correlation between diabetes and sexual dysfunction in females than in males.,1
Oral contraceptive pills can cause blood sugar imbalances in women who have diabetes.,1
" Dosage changes can help address that, at the risk of side effects and complications.",1
Women with type 1 diabetes show a higher than normal rate of polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS.,1
 The reason may be that the ovaries are exposed to high insulin concentrations since women with type 1 diabetes can have frequent hyperglycemia.,1
Epidemiology Type 1 diabetes makes up an estimated 5‚ 10% of all diabetes cases or 11‚ 22 million worldwide.,1
" In 2006 it affected 440,000 children under 14 years of age and was the primary cause of diabetes in those less than 10 years of age.",1
 The incidence of type 1 diabetes has been increasing by about 3% per year.,1
Rates vary widely by country.,1
" In Finland, the incidence is a high of 57 per 100,000 per year, in Japan and China a low of 1 to 3 per 100,000 per year, and in Northern Europe and the U.",1
", an intermediate of 8 to 17 per 100,000 per year.",1
"In the United States, type 1 and 2 diabetes affected about 208,000 youths under the age of 20 in 2015.",1
" Over 18,000 youths are diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes every year.",1
" Every year about 234,051 Americans die due to diabetes type I or II or diabetes-related complications, with 69,071 having it as the primary cause of death.",1
"In Australia, about one million people have been diagnosed with diabetes and of this figure 130,000 people have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.",1
 Australia ranks 6th-highest in the world with children under 14 years of age.,1
" Between 2000 and 2013, 31,895 new cases were established, with 2,323 in 2013, a rate of 10‚ 13 cases per 100,00 people each year.",1
 Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islander people are less affected.,1
"History Type 1 diabetes was described as an autoimmune disease in the 1970s, based on observations that autoantibodies against islets were discovered in diabetics with other autoimmune deficiencies.",1
" It was also shown in the 1980s that immunosuppressive therapies could slow disease progression, further supporting the idea that type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder.",1
 The name juvenile diabetes was used earlier as it often first is diagnosed in childhood.,1
Society and culture Type 1 and 2 diabetes was estimated to cause $10.,1
" Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and was previously known as juvenile diabetes.",1
" In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin .",1
" More specifically, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the body‚ immune system has attacked and destroyed them.",1
" Insulin is a hormone that is needed to convert sugar glucose , starches and other food into energy needed for daily life.",1
" The causes of type 1 diabetes appear to be much different than those for type 2 diabetes, though the exact mechanisms for developing both diseases are unknown.",1
" The appearance of type 1 diabetes is suspected to follow exposure to an environmental trigger, such as an unidentified virus, stimulating an immune attack against the beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin in some genetically predisposed people.",1
 What are the symptoms of Diabetes mellitus type 1.,1
 People who think they might have diabetes must visit a physician for diagnosis.,1
 They might have some or none of the following symptoms Frequent urination Excessive thirst Unexplained weight loss Extreme hunger Sudden vision changes Tingling or numbness in hands or feet Fatigue Very dry skin Sores that are slow to heal More infections than usual.,1
" Nausea , vomiting , or stomach pains may accompany some of these symptoms in the abrupt onset of insulin-dependent diabetes, now called type 1 diabetes.",1
 Diseases with similar symptoms Diabetes mellitus type 2 Diabetes insipidus Gestational diabetes What causes Diabetes mellitus type 1.,1
 There are several forms of diabetes.,1
 Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile or insulin-dependent diabetes.,1
" Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults.",1
" Insulin is a hormone produced by special cells, called beta cells, in the pancreas, an organ located in the area behind your stomach.",1
" Insulin is needed to move blood sugar glucose into cells, where it is stored and later used for energy.",1
" In type 1 diabetes, these cells produce little or no insulin.",1
 The body is unable to use this glucose for energy.,1
" Within 5 - 10 years, the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are completely destroyed and the body can no longer produce insulin.",1
" The exact cause is unknown, but most likely there is a viral or environmental trigger in genetically susceptible people that causes an immune reaction.",1
 But the most serious problem caused by diabetes is heart disease .,1
" When you have diabetes, you are more than twice as likely as people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke .",1
" If you have diabetes, your risk of a heart attack is the same as someone who has already had a heart attack.",1
 Both women and men with diabetes are at risk.,1
 You may not even have the typical signs of a heart attack .,1
 You can reduce your risk of developing heart disease by controlling your blood pressure and blood fat levels.,1
" If you smoke, talk with your doctor about quitting.",1
" Anyone aged 45 years or older should consider getting tested for diabetes, especially if you are overweight .",1
" If you are younger than 45, but are overweight and have one or more additional risk factors, you should consider testing.",1
" In addition, if blood glucose levels get too high or low, urgent medical care may be needed to prevent losing consciousness or a diabetic coma .",1
 Diagnosis There are two different tests your doctor can use to determine whether you have pre-diabetes or diabetes the fasting plasma glucose test FPG or the oral glucose tolerance test OGTT .,1
" The blood glucose levels measured after these tests determine whether you have a normal metabolism, or whether you have pre-diabetes or diabetes.",1
" If your blood glucose level is abnormal following the FPG, you have impaired fasting glucose IFG; if your blood glucose level is abnormal following the OGTT, you have impaired glucose tolerance IGT.",1
 FPG OGTT Treatment options The main goal of treatment is to get your blood glucose sugar levels under control in order to increase your chances of a complication-free life.,1
 People with diabetes should see a health care provider who will monitor their diabetes control and help them learn to manage their diabetes.,1
" In addition, many people with type 1 diabetes require oral medication, insulin, or both to control their blood glucose levels.",1
" Healthy Living Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes.",1
" People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care, and keep blood glucose levels from going too low or too high.",1
 Blood glucose monitoring is the main tool you have to check your diabetes control.,1
 This check tells you your blood glucose level at any one time.,1
 Keeping a log of your results is vital.,1
Macrovascular disease may be less related to glycemia.,1
Telomere attrition may be a marker associated with presence and the number of diabetic complications.,1
Whether it is a cause or a consequence of diabetes remains to be seen.,1
"Cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes is related in part to insulin resistance, with the following concomitant lipid abnormalities Elevated levels of small, dense low-density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol particles Low levels of high-density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol Elevated levels of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins Thrombotic abnormalities ie, elevated type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI-1], elevated fibrinogen and hypertension are also involved.",1
"Other conventional atherosclerotic risk factors eg, family history, smoking, elevated LDL cholesterol also affect cardiovascular risk.",1
"Insulin resistance is associated with increased lipid accumulation in liver and smooth muscle, but not with increased myocardial lipid accumulation.",1
"Persistent lipid abnormalities remain in patients with diabetes despite the use of lipid-modifying drugs, although evidence supports the benefits of these drugs.",1
Statin dose up-titration and the addition of other lipid-modifying agents are needed.,1
"Increased cardiovascular risk appears to begin prior to the development of frank hyperglycemia, presumably because of the effects of insulin resistance.",1
"Stern in 1996 and Haffner and DAgostino in 1999 developed the ticking clock hypothesis of complications, asserting that the clock starts ticking for microvascular risk at the onset of hyperglycemia, while the clock starts ticking for macrovascular risk at some antecedent point, presumably with the onset of insulin resistance.",1
The question of when diabetes becomes a cardiovascular risk equivalent has not yet been settled.,1
Debate has moved beyond automatically considering diabetes a cardiovascular risk equivalent.,1
Perhaps it would be prudent to assume the equivalency with diabetes that is more than 5-10 years in duration.,1
"In a cross-sectional study of 350 patients aged 55 years and older with type 2 diabetes and 363 control participants aged 60 years and older without diabetes, diabetic individuals were more likely to have brain atrophy than cerebrovascular lesions, with patterns resembling those of preclinical Alzheimer disease.",1
Type 2 diabetes was associated with hippocampal atrophy.,1
"temporal, frontal, and limbic gray-matter atrophy.",1
"and, to a lesser extent, frontal and temporal white-matter atrophy.",1
Type 2 diabetes was also linked with poorer performance on certain cognitive tests.,1
The strength of these associations dropped by almost 50% when adjusted for hippocampal and total gray-matter volumes but was unchanged when adjusted for cerebrovascular lesions or white-matter volume.,1
"Patients with type 2 diabetes were more likely to have gray-matter atrophy in several bilateral regions of the cortices, especially in the left hemisphere, similar to the distribution of cortical atrophy described in early Alzheimer disease.",1
"In a 40-month study of 2977 middle-aged and older adults with long-standing type 2 diabetes, depression at baseline was associated with accelerated cognitive decline.",1
"The 531 subjects with scores of 10 or higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale at baseline had significantly lower scores on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test DSST, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test RAVLT, and the modified Stroop test.",1
Adjustment for other risk factors did not affect the association.,1
"Various other types of diabetes, previously called secondary diabetes, are caused by other illnesses or medications.",1
"Depending on the primary process involved eg, destruction of pancreatic beta cells or development of peripheral insulin resistance, these types of diabetes behave similarly to type 1 or type 2 diabetes.",1
A steady decline in insulin sensitivity as gestation progresses is a normal feature of pregnancy.,1
gestational diabetes mellitus results when maternal insulin secretion cannot increase sufficiently to counteract the decrease in insulin sensitivity.,1
"A study by Ahlqvist et al suggested that type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus can actually be divided into five separate types, or clusters, of diabetes.",1
"Using six variables to analyze almost 15,000 patients in Sweden and Finland, the investigators came up with the following clusters, the first of which corresponds to type 1 diabetes and the rest of which are subtypes of type 2 diabetes The investigators maintained that studies in less homogeneous populations are needed to confirm their results but see their report as a ‚ first step towards a more precise, clinically useful stratification‚ of diabetes.",1
The etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to involve complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors.,1
"Presumably, the disease develops when a diabetogenic lifestyle ie, excessive caloric intake, inadequate caloric expenditure, obesity is superimposed on a susceptible genotype.",1
The body mass index BMI at which excess weight increases risk for diabetes varies with different racial groups.,1
"For example, compared with persons of European ancestry, persons of Asian ancestry are at increased risk for diabetes at lower levels of overweight.",1
Hypertension and prehypertension are associated with a greater risk of developing diabetes in whites than in African Americans.,1
"In addition, an in utero environment resulting in low birth weight may predispose some individuals to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus.",1
"Infant weight velocity has a small, indirect effect on adult insulin resistance, and this is primarily mediated through its effect on BMI and waist circumference.",1
About 90% of patients who develop type 2 diabetes mellitus are obese.,1
"However, a large, population-based, prospective study has shown that an energy-dense diet may be a risk factor for the development of diabetes that is independent of baseline obesity.",1
Some studies suggest that environmental pollutants may play a role in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,1
A structured and planned platform is needed to fully explore the diabetes-inducing potential of environmental pollutants.,1
"Secondary diabetes may occur in patients taking glucocorticoids or when patients have conditions that antagonize the actions of insulin eg, Cushing syndrome, acromegaly, pheochromocytoma.",1
"The major risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus are the following Age greater than 45 years though, as noted above, type 2 diabetes mellitus is occurring with increasing frequency in young individuals Weight greater than 120% of desirable body weight Family history of type 2 diabetes in a first-degree relative eg, parent or sibling Hispanic, Native American, African American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander descent History of previous impaired glucose tolerance IGT or impaired fasting glucose IFG Hypertension >140/90 mm Hg or dyslipidemia HDL cholesterol level < 40 mg/dL or triglyceride level >150 mg/dL History of gestational diabetes mellitus or of delivering a baby with a birth weight of over 9 lb Polycystic ovarian syndrome which results in insulin resistance The genetics of type 2 diabetes are complex and not completely understood.",1
Evidence supports the involvement of multiple genes in pancreatic beta-cell failure and insulin resistance.,1
Genome-wide association studies have identified dozens of common genetic variants associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes.,1
"Of the variants thus far discovered, the one with the strongest effect on susceptibility is the transcription factor 7‚ like 2 gene.",1
The trait is autosomal dominant and can be screened for through commercial laboratories.,1
"To date, 11 MODY subtypes have been identified, involving mutations in the following genes HNF-4-alpha Glucokinase gene HNF-1-alpha IPF-1 HNF-1-beta NEUROD1 KLF11 CEL PAX4 INS BLK Most of the MODY subtypes are associated with diabetes only.",1
"however, MODY type 5 is known to be associated with renal cysts, and MODY type 8 is associated with exocrine pancreatic dysfunction.",1
A number of variants in mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid DNA have been proposed as an etiologic factor for a small percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes.,1
Two specific point mutations and some deletions and duplications in the mitochondrial genome can cause type 2 diabetes and sensorineural hearing loss.,1
"Diabetes can also be a finding in more severe mitochondrial disorders such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episode MELAS.",1
"Mitochondrial forms of diabetes mellitus should be considered when diabetes occurs in conjunction with hearing loss, myopathy, seizure disorder, strokelike episodes, retinitis pigmentosa, external ophthalmoplegia, or cataracts.",1
These findings are of particular significance if there is evidence of maternal inheritance.,1
A meta-analysis of two studies indicated that a genetically associated low birth weight increases an individual‚ s risk for developing type 2 diabetes.,1
"The report found that for each one-point increase in an individual‚ s genetic risk score for low birth weight, the type 2 diabetes risk rose by 6%.",1
Accumulating evidence suggests that depression is a significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes.,1
Pan et al found that the relative risk was 1.17 in women with depressed mood and 1.25 in women using antidepressants.,1
"Antidepressant use may be a marker of more severe, chronic, or recurrent depression, or antidepressant use itself may increase diabetes risk, possibly by altering glucose homeostasis or promoting weight gain.",1
"In turn, type 2 diabetes has been identified as a risk factor for the development of depression.",1
Depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder are twice as prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes as in the general population.,1
Schizophrenia has been linked to the risk for type 2 diabetes.,1
Dysfunctional signaling involving protein kinase B Akt is a possible mechanism for schizophrenia.,1
"moreover, acquired Akt defects are associated with impaired regulation of blood glucose and diabetes, which is overrepresented in first-episode, medication-naive patients with schizophrenia.",1
"In addition, second-generation antipsychotics are associated with greater risk for type-2 diabetes.",1
"A population-based, retrospective cohort study of 1,010,068 pregnant women examined the association between preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy and the risk of developing diabetes post partum.",1
"Results showed the incidence rate of diabetes per 1000 person-years was 6.47 for women with preeclampsia and 5.26 for those with gestational hypertension, compared with 2.81 in women with neither condition.",1
Risk was further elevated in women with preeclampsia or gesntational hypertension comorbid with gestational diabetes.,1
"A 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC report estimated that in the United States, as of 2015, 30.3 million persons of all ages, or 9.4% of the population, had diabetes including 30.2 million adults aged 18 years or above, or 12.2% of all US adults and 84.1 million adults 33.9% of the adult population had prediabetes.",1
"Prediabetes, as defined by the American Diabetes Association, is that state in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.",1
It is presumed that most persons with prediabetes will subsequently progress to diabetes.,1
"In 2015, according to the CDC report, prediabetes was present in 23.1 million persons aged 65 years or older 48.3%.",1
"As estimated for 2015, diabetes occurred in an estimated 4.6 million adults aged 18-44 years 4.0%, 14.3 million aged 45-64 years 17.0%, and 12.0 million aged 65 years or older 25.2%.",1
"Of those adults with diabetes, however, 7.2 million did not know or did not report that they had diabetes.",1
"In 2014, the CDC reported that about 40% of US adults will develop diabetes, primarily type 2, in their lifetime, and more than 50% of ethnic minorities will be affected.",1
This is substantially higher than previous estimates.,1
The central reason for the increase is obesity.,1
A study by Ludwig et al found that neighborhoods with high levels of poverty are associated with increases in the incidence of extreme obesity and diabetes.,1
"Although the mechanisms behind this association is unclear, further investigation is warranted.",1
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is less common in non-Western countries where the diet contains fewer calories and daily caloric expenditure is higher.,1
"However, as people in these countries adopt Western lifestyles, weight gain and type 2 diabetes mellitus are becoming virtually epidemic.",1
Rates of diabetes are increasing worldwide.,1
The International Diabetes Federation predicts that the number of people living with diabetes will to rise from 366 million in 2011 to 552 million by 2030.,1
"In the United States, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes has more than doubled in the last 3 decades, largely because of the increase in obesity.",1
"The top 10 countries in number of people with diabetes are currently India, China, the United States, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Brazil, Italy, and Bangladesh.",1
The greatest percentage increase in rates of diabetes will occur in Africa over the next 20 years.,1
"Unfortunately, at least 80% of people in Africa with diabetes are undiagnosed, and many in their 30s to 60s will die from diabetes there.",1
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus varies widely among various racial and ethnic groups.,1
The image below shows data for various populations.,1
"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is more prevalent among Hispanics, Native Americans, African Americans, and Asians/Pacific Islanders than in non-Hispanic whites.",1
"Indeed, the disease is becoming virtually pandemic in some groups of Native Americans and Hispanic people.",1
"The risk of retinopathy and nephropathy appears to be greater in blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics.",1
"In a study by Selvin et al, differences between blacks and whites were noted in many glycemic markers and not just the hemoglobin A1c HbA1c level.",1
"This suggests real differences in glycemia, rather than in the hemoglobin glycation process or erythrocyte turnover, between blacks and whites.",1
"Type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs most commonly in adults aged 40 years or older, and the prevalence of the disease increases with advancing age.",1
"Indeed, the aging of the population is one reason that type 2 diabetes mellitus is becoming increasingly common.",1
Virtually all cases of diabetes mellitus in older individuals are type 2.,1
"In addition, however, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing more rapidly in adolescents and young adults than in other age groups.",1
"The disease is being recognized increasingly in younger persons, particularly in highly susceptible racial and ethnic groups and the obese.",1
"In some areas, more type 2 than type 1 diabetes mellitus is being diagnosed in prepubertal children, teenagers, and young adults.",1
Those in the intensely treated group had a significantly lower rate of progression of microvascular complications than did patients receiving standard care.,1
"Rates of macrovascular disease were not altered except in the metformin-monotherapy arm in obese individuals, in which the risk of myocardial infarction was significantly decreased.",1
"In the 10-year follow-up to the UKPDS, patients in the previously intensively treated group demonstrated a continued reduction in microvascular and all-cause mortality, as well as in cardiovascular events, despite early loss of differences in glycated hemoglobin levels between the intensive-therapy and conventional-therapy groups.",1
"The total follow-up was 20 years, half while in the study and half after the study ended.",1
"Other, shorter studies, such as Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation ADVANCE and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial VADT, showed no improvement in cardiovascular disease and death with tight control lower targets than in the UKPDS.",1
"In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ACCORD study, increased mortality was noted among the poorly-controlled patients in the intensive glycemic arm.",1
indeed there was a 66% increase in mortality for each 1% increase in HbA1c.,1
the best outcome occurred among patients who achieved the target of an HbA1c of less than 6%.,1
The excess mortality between the intensive and conventional glycemic arms occurred for A1c above 7%.,1
Differences between the patient populations in these studies and the UKPDS may account for some of the differences in outcome.,1
"The patients in these 3 studies had established diabetes and had a prior cardiovascular disease event or were at high risk for a cardiovascular disease event, whereas patients in the UKPDS study were younger, with new-onset diabetes and low rates of cardiovascular disease.",1
"Early, intensive, multifactorial blood pressure, cholesterol management in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with a small, nonsignificant reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease events and death in a multinational European study.",1
"The 3057 patients in this study had diabetes detected by screening and were randomized to receive either standard diabetes care or intensive management of hyperglycemia target HbA1c < 7.0%, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.",1
"The benefits of intensive intervention were demonstrated in the Steno-2 study in Denmark, which included 160 patients with type 2 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria.",1
"the mean treatment period was 7.8 years, followed by an observational period for a mean of 5.5 years.",1
"Intensive therapy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events, death from cardiovascular causes, progression to end-stage renal disease, and need for retinal photocoagulation.",1
A British study indicated that the HbA1c level achieved 3 months after the initial diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus predicts subsequent mortality.,1
"In other words, according to the report, aggressive lowering of glucose after diagnosis bodes well for long-term survival.",1
Intensified diabetes control must be introduced gradually in newly diagnosed patients.,1
"Another study, a review of randomized clinical trials, showed that intensive glycemic control reduces the risk of microvascular complications, but at the expense of increased risk of hypoglycemia.",1
All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in the study did not differ significantly with intensive versus conventional glycemic control.,1
"however, trials conducted in usual-care settings showed a reduction in the risk of nonfatal m",1
"Type 2 diabetes T2D, formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin.",1
"Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss.",1
"Symptoms may also include increased hunger, feeling tired, and sores that do not heal.",1
Often symptoms come on slowly.,1
"Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, strokes, diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations.",1
The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur.,1
"however, ketoacidosis is uncommon.Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise.",1
Some people are more genetically at risk than others.,1
"Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes, with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.",1
"In type 1 diabetes there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose, due to an autoimmune induced loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.",1
"Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated hemoglobin A1C.Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable by staying a normal weight, exercising regularly, and eating properly.",1
Treatment involves exercise and dietary changes.,1
"If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered, the medication metformin is typically recommended.",1
Many people may eventually also require insulin injections.,1
"In those on insulin, routinely checking blood sugar levels is advised.",1
"however, this may not be needed in those taking pills.",1
Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese.Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity.,1
As of 2015 there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985.,1
"Typically it begins in middle or older age, although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people.",1
Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.,1
Diabetes was one of the first diseases described.,1
The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s.,1
"Signs and symptomsThe classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination polyuria, increased thirst polydipsia, increased hunger polyphagia, and weight loss.",1
"Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, itchiness, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vaginal infections, and fatigue.",1
Other symptoms may include loss of taste.,1
" Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing.",1
A small number of people with type 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure.,1
 Complications Type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.,1
"This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated, including two to four times the risk of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease and stroke.",1
"a 20-fold increase in lower limb amputations, and increased rates of hospitalizations.",1
"In the developed world, and increasingly elsewhere, type 2 diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure.",1
It has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as Alzheimers disease and vascular dementia.,1
"Other complications include acanthosis nigricans, sexual dysfunction, and frequent infections.",1
There is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss.,1
Causes The development of type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.,1
"While some of these factors are under personal control, such as diet and obesity, other factors are not, such as increasing age, female gender, and genetics.",1
Obesity is more common in women than men in many parts of Africa.,1
"The nutritional status of a mother during fetal development may also play a role, with one proposed mechanism being that of DNA methylation.",1
The intestinal bacteria Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus have been connected with type 2 diabetes.,1
" Lifestyle Lifestyle factors are important to the development of type 2 diabetes, including obesity and being overweight defined by a body mass index of greater than 25, lack of physical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization.",1
"Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60‚ 80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of cases in Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.",1
"Among those who are not obese, a high waist‚ hip ratio is often present.",1
Smoking appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.,1
 A lack of sleep has also been linked to type 2 diabetes.,1
"Laboratory studies have linked short-term sleep deprivations to changes in glucose metabolism, nervous system activity, or hormonal factors that may lead to diabetes.Dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",1
Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk.,1
"The type of fats in the diet are important, with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk, and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk.",1
Eating a lot of white rice appears to play a role in increasing risk.,1
A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7% of cases.,1
Persistent organic pollutants may play a role.,1
"Other health problems that are associated include acromegaly, Cushings syndrome, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, and certain cancers such as glucagonomas.",1
Individuals with cancer may be at a higher risk of mortality if they also have diabetes.,1
Testosterone deficiency is also associated with type 2 diabetes.,1
"Eating disorders may also interact with type 2 diabetes, with bulimia nervosa increasing the risk and anorexia nervosa decreasing it.",1
Pathophysiology Type 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance.,1
"Insulin resistance, which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin, occurs primarily within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue.",1
"In the liver, insulin normally suppresses glucose release.",1
"However, in the setting of insulin resistance, the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood.",1
"The proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals, with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion.Other potentially important mechanisms associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance include increased breakdown of lipids within fat cells, resistance to and lack of incretin, high glucagon levels in the blood, increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys, and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system.",1
"However, not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required.In the early stages of insulin resistance, the mass of beta cells expands, increasing the output of insulin to compensate for the insulin insensitivity.",1
"But when type 2 diabetes has become manifest, a type 2 diabetic will have lost about half of their beta cells.Fatty acids in the beta cells activate FOXO1, resulting in apopotosis of the beta cells.",1
"Diagnosis The World Health Organization definition of diabetes both type 1 and type 2 is for a single raised glucose reading with symptoms, otherwise raised values on two occasions, of either fasting plasma glucose is another method of diagnosing diabetes.",1
"In 2009 an International Expert Committee that included representatives of the American Diabetes Association ADA, the International Diabetes Federation IDF, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes EASD recommended that a threshold of 48 mmol/mol should be used to diagnose diabetes.",1
This recommendation was adopted by the American Diabetes Association in 2010.,1
