Reyes syndrome seems to be triggered by using aspirin to treat a viral illness or infection ‚ particularly flu influenza and chickenpox ‚ in children and teenagers who have an underlying fatty acid oxidation disorder.,1
Fatty acid oxidation disorders are a group of inherited metabolic disorders in which the body is unable to break down fatty acids because an enzyme is missing or not working properly.,1
A screening test is needed to determine if your child has a fatty acid oxidation disorder.,1
"In some cases, Reyes syndrome may be an underlying metabolic condition thats unmasked by a viral illness.",1
"Exposure to certain toxins ‚ such as insecticides, herbicides and paint thinner ‚ also may contribute to Reyes syndrome.",1
"The following factors ‚ usually when they occur together ‚ may increase your childs risk of developing Reyes syndrome: Using aspirin to treat a viral infection, such as flu, chickenpox or an upper respiratory infection Having an underlying fatty acid oxidation disorder Most children and teenagers who have Reyes syndrome survive, although varying degrees of permanent brain damage are possible.",1
"Without proper diagnosis and treatment, Reyes syndrome can be fatal within a few days.",1
Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers.,1
This includes plain aspirin and medications that contain aspirin.,1
Some hospitals and medical facilities conduct newborn screenings for fatty acid oxidation disorders to determine which children are at greater risk of developing Reyes syndrome.,1
Children with known fatty acid oxidation disorders should not take aspirin or aspirin-containing products.,1
"Always check the label before you give your child medication, including over-the-counter products and alternative or herbal remedies.",1
"Aspirin can show up in some unexpected places, such as Alka-Seltzer.",1

"Theres one caveat to the aspirin rule, however.",1
"Children and teenagers who have certain chronic diseases, such as Kawasaki disease, may need long-term treatment with drugs that contain aspirin.",1
"If your child needs aspirin therapy, make sure his or her vaccines are current ‚ including two doses of the varicella chickenpox vaccine and a yearly flu vaccine.",1
Avoiding these two viral illnesses can help prevent Reyes syndrome.,1
Theres no specific test for Reyes syndrome.,1
"Instead, screening for Reyes syndrome usually begins with blood and urine tests as well as testing for fatty acid oxidation disorders and other metabolic disorders.",1
Sometimes more-invasive diagnostic tests are needed to evaluate other possible causes of liver problems and investigate any neurological abnormalities.,1
For example: Spinal tap lumbar puncture.,1
" A spinal tap can help the doctor identify or rule out other diseases with similar signs and symptoms, such as infection of the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord meningitis or inflammation or infection of the brain encephalitis.",1
" During a spinal tap, a needle is inserted through the lower back into a space below the end of the spinal cord.",1

An MRI scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves rather than X-rays to generate images of the brain.,1
Skin biopsy.,1
 Testing for fatty acid oxidation disorders or metabolic disorders may require a skin biopsy.,1
" During a skin biopsy, a doctor takes a small skin sample biopsy for analysis in a lab.",1
A biopsy can usually be done in a doctors office using a local anesthetic.,1
 Reyes syndrome is usually treated in the hospital.,1

Medications to prevent bleeding.,1
" Bleeding due to liver abnormalities may require treatment with vitamin K, plasma and platelets.",1
Cooling blankets.,1
 This intervention helps maintain internal body temperature at a safe level.,1
"If your child has trouble breathing, he or she may need assistance from a breathing machine ventilator.",1
" Explore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.",1
" Reyes syndrome is often diagnosed in an emergency situation because of serious signs and symptoms, such as seizures or loss of consciousness.",1
"In some cases, early signs and symptoms prompt a doctors appointment.",1
Youll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in conditions of the brain and nervous system neurologist.,1
"Because appointments can be brief and theres often a lot of ground to cover, it can help to be well-prepared.",1
Here are some tips to help you get ready for your appointment.,1
Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions.,1
" At the time you make the appointment, ask if theres anything you need to do in advance.",1
"Write down any symptoms your child is experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.",1
"Make a list of all medications, including vitamins, dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs, that your child has taken, especially any containing aspirin.",1
"Even better, take the original bottles and a written list of the dosages and directions.",1
Take along a family member or friend.,1
 It can be difficult to recall all the information provided to you during an appointment.,1
The person who accompanies you may remember something that you forgot or missed.,1
Write down questions to ask your doctor.,1
 Dont be afraid to ask questions or to speak up when you dont understand something your doctor says.,1
List your questions from most important to least important in case your time with your doctor runs out.,1
For Reyes syndrome some basic questions to ask your doctor include: What are other possible causes for my childs symptoms.,1
What tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis.,1
What are the treatment options and the pros and cons for each.,1
What results can I expect.,1
What kind of follow-up should I expect.,1
"In addition to the questions that youve prepared to ask your doctor, dont hesitate to ask questions during your appointment.",1
The neurologist is likely to ask about your childs symptoms and history of viral illnesses.,1
"The doctor will also conduct a medical exam and schedule tests to gather information about your childs condition and to rule out other diseases, such as meningitis or encephalitis.",1
Alzheimers disease is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to waste away degenerate and die.,1
"Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia ‚ a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that disrupts a persons ability to function independently.",1
The early signs of the disease may be forgetting recent events or conversations.,1
"As the disease progresses, a person with Alzheimers disease will develop severe memory impairment and lose the ability to carry out everyday tasks.",1
Current Alzheimers disease medications may temporarily improve symptoms or slow the rate of decline.,1
These treatments can sometimes help people with Alzheimers disease maximize function and maintain independence for a time.,1
Different programs and services can help support people with Alzheimers disease and their caregivers.,1
There is no treatment that cures Alzheimers disease or alters the disease process in the brain.,1
"In advanced stages of the disease, complications from severe loss of brain function ‚ such as dehydration, malnutrition or infection ‚ result in death.",1
Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimers disease.,1
An early sign of the disease is usually difficulty remembering recent events or conversations.,1
"As the disease progresses, memory impairments worsen and other symptoms develop.",1
"A variation of the gene, APOE e4, increases the risk of Alzheimers disease, but not everyone with this variation of the gene develops the disease.",1
Scientists have identified rare changes mutations in three genes that virtually guarantee a person who inherits one of them will develop Alzheimers.,1
But these mutations account for less than 1 percent of people with Alzheimers disease.,1
Many people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimers disease.,1
This is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 21 ‚ and subsequently three copies of the gene for the protein that leads to the creation of beta-amyloid.,1
Signs and symptoms of Alzheimers tend to appear 10 to 20 years earlier in people with Down syndrome than they do for the general population.,1
"There appears to be little difference in risk between men and women, but, overall, there are more women with the disease because they generally live longer than men.",1
"Mild cognitive impairment MCI is a decline in memory or other thinking skills that is greater than what would be expected for a persons age, but the decline doesnt prevent a person from functioning in social or work environments.",1
People who have MCI have a significant risk of developing dementia.,1
"When the primary MCI deficit is memory, the condition is more likely to progress to dementia due to Alzheimers disease.",1
"A diagnosis of MCI enables the person to focus on healthy lifestyle changes, develop strategies to compensate for memory loss and schedule regular doctor appointments to monitor symptoms.",1
People whove had a severe head trauma have a greater risk of Alzheimers disease.,1
"Research has shown that poor sleep patterns, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimers disease.",1
 Research has shown that the same risk factors associated with heart disease may also increase the risk of Alzheimers disease.,1
These include: Lack of exercise Obesity Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke High blood pressure High cholesterol Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes These factors can all be modified.,1
"Therefore, changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk.",1
"For example, regular exercise and a healthy low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with a decreased risk of developing Alzheimers disease.",1
Studies have found an association between lifelong involvement in mentally and socially stimulating activities and a reduced risk of Alzheimers disease.,1
Low education levels ‚ less than a high school education ‚ appear to be a risk factor for Alzheimers disease.,1
"Memory and language loss, impaired judgment, and other cognitive changes caused by Alzheimers can complicate treatment for other health conditions.",1
"A person with Alzheimers disease may not be able to: Communicate that he or she is experiencing pain ‚ for example, from a dental problem Report symptoms of another illness Follow a prescribed treatment plan Notice or describe medication side effects As Alzheimers disease progresses to its last stages, brain changes begin to affect physical functions, such as swallowing, balance, and bowel and bladder control.",1
These effects can increase vulnerability to additional health problems such as: Inhaling food or liquid into the lungs aspiration Pneumonia and other infections Falls Fractures Bedsores Malnutrition or dehydration Alzheimers disease is not a preventable condition.,1
"However, a number of lifestyle risk factors for Alzheimers can be modified.",1
"Evidence suggests that changes in diet, exercise and habits ‚ steps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease ‚ may also lower your risk of developing Alzheimers disease and other disorders that cause dementia.",1
"Heart-healthy lifestyle choices that may reduce the risk of Alzheimers include the following: Exercise regularly Eat a diet of fresh produce, healthy oils and foods low in saturated fat Follow treatment guidelines to manage high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol If you smoke, ask your doctor for help to quit smoking Studies have shown that preserved thinking skills later in life and a reduced risk of Alzheimers disease are associated with participating in social events, reading, dancing, playing board games, creating art, playing an instrument, and other activities that require mental and social engagement.",1
"A key component of a diagnostic assessment is self-reporting about symptoms, as well as the information that a close family member or friend can provide about symptoms and their impact on daily life.",1
"Additionally, a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease is based on tests your doctor administers to assess memory and thinking skills.",1
Laboratory and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes or help the doctor better characterize the disease causing dementia symptoms.,1
The entire set of diagnostic tools is designed to detect dementia and determine with relatively high accuracy whether Alzheimers disease or another condition is the cause.,1
"Alzheimers disease can be diagnosed with complete certainty after death, when microscopic examination of the brain reveals the characteristic plaques and tangles.",1
"A diagnostic work-up would likely include the following tests: Your doctor will perform a physical exam and likely assess overall neurological health by testing the following: Reflexes Muscle tone and strength Ability to get up from a chair and walk across the room Sense of sight and hearing Coordination Balance Blood tests may help your doctor rule out other potential causes of memory loss and confusion, such as a thyroid disorder or vitamin deficiencies.",1
Your doctor may conduct a brief mental status test or a more extensive set of tests to assess memory and other thinking skills.,1
Longer forms of neuropsychological testing may provide additional details about mental function compared with people of a similar age and education level.,1
These tests are also important for establishing a starting point to track the progression of symptoms in the future.,1
"Images of the brain are now used chiefly to pinpoint visible abnormalities related to conditions other than Alzheimers disease ‚ such as strokes, trauma or tumors ‚ that may cause cognitive change.",1
New imaging applications ‚ currently used primarily in major medical centers or in clinical trials ‚ may enable doctors to detect specific brain changes caused by Alzheimers.,1
Imaging of brain structures include the following: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI.,1
 MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of the brain.,1
MRI scans are used primarily to rule out other conditions.,1
"While they may show brain shrinkage, the information doesnt currently add significant value to making a diagnosis.",1
Computerized tomography CT.,1
" A CT scan, a specialized X-ray technology, produces cross-sectional images slices of your brain.",1
"Its currently used chiefly to rule out tumors, strokes and head injuries.",1
Imaging of disease processes can be performed with positron emission tomography PET.,1
"During a PET scan, a low-level radioactive tracer is injected into the blood to reveal a particular feature in the brain.",1
PET imaging may include the following: Fluorodeoxyglucose FDG PET scans show areas of the brain in which nutrients are poorly metabolized.,1
Identifying patterns of degeneration ‚ areas of low metabolism ‚ can help distinguish between Alzheimers disease and other types of dementia.,1
Amyloid PET imaging can measure the burden of amyloid deposits in the brain.,1
This imaging is primarily used in research but may be used if a person has unusual or very early onset of dementia symptoms.,1
"Tau Pet imaging, which measures the burden of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, is only used in research.",1
"In special circumstances, such as rapidly progressive dementia or very early onset dementia, other tests may be used to measure abnormal beta-amyloid or tau in the cerebrospinal fluid.",1
Researchers are working on tests that can measure the biological evidence of disease processes in the brain.,1
These tests may improve the accuracy of diagnoses and enable earlier diagnosis before the onset of symptoms.,1
Genetic testing generally isnt recommended for a routine Alzheimers disease evaluation.,1
The exception is people who have a family history of early-onset Alzheimers disease.,1
Meeting with a genetic counselor to discuss the risks and benefits of genetic testing is recommended before undergoing any tests.,1
Current Alzheimers medications can help for a time with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes.,1
Two types of drugs are currently used to treat cognitive symptoms: Cholinesterase inhibitors.,1
 These drugs work by boosting levels of cell-to-cell communication by preserving a chemical messenger that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimers disease.,1
The improvement is modest.,1
" Cholinesterase inhibitors may also improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation or depression.",1
"Commonly prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors include donepezil Aricept, galantamine Razadyne and rivastigmine Exelon.",1
" The main side effects of these drugs include diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and sleep disturbances.",1
"In people with cardiac conduction disorders, serious side effects may include cardiac arrhythmia.",1
 Memantine Namenda.,1
 This drug works in another brain cell communication network and slows the progression of symptoms with moderate to severe Alzheimers disease.,1
Its sometimes used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor.,1
Relatively rare side effects include dizziness and confusion.,1
Sometimes other medications such as antidepressants may be prescribed to help control the behavioral symptoms associated with Alzheimers disease.,1
Adapting the living situation to the needs of a person with Alzheimers disease is an important part of any treatment plan.,1
"For someone with Alzheimers, establishing and strengthening routine habits and minimizing memory-demanding tasks can make life much easier.",1
"You can take these steps to support a persons sense of well-being and continued ability to function: Always keep keys, wallets, mobile phones and other valuables in the same place at home, so they dont become lost.",1
Keep medications in a secure location.,1
Use a daily checklist to keep track of dosages.,1
Arrange for finances to be on automatic payment and automatic deposit.,1
Carry a mobile phone with location capability so that a caregiver can track its location.,1
Program important phone numbers into the phone.,1
Make sure regular appointments are on the same day at the same time as much as possible.,1
Use a calendar or whiteboard in the home to track daily schedules.,1
Build the habit of checking off completed items.,1
"Remove excess furniture, clutter and throw rugs.",1
Install sturdy handrails on stairways and in bathrooms.,1
Ensure that shoes and slippers are comfortable and provide good traction.,1
Reduce the number of mirrors.,1
People with Alzheimers may find images in mirrors confusing or frightening.,1
Make sure that the person with Alzheimers carries identification or wears a medical alert bracelet.,1
Keep photographs and other meaningful objects around the house.,1
" Various herbal remedies, vitamins and other supplements are widely promoted as preparations that may support cognitive health or prevent or delay Alzheimers.",1
Clinical trials have produced mixed results with little evidence to support them as effective treatments.,1
"Frontotemporal dementia frontotemporal lobar degeneration is an umbrella term for a diverse group of uncommon disorders that primarily affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain ‚ the areas generally associated with personality, behavior and language.",1
"In frontotemporal dementia, portions of these lobes shrink atrophy.",1
"Signs and symptoms vary, depending upon the portion of the brain affected.",1
" Some people with frontotemporal dementia undergo dramatic changes in their personality and become socially inappropriate, impulsive or emotionally indifferent, while others lose the ability to use language.",1
Frontotemporal dementia is often misdiagnosed as a psychiatric problem or as Alzheimers disease.,1
"But frontotemporal dementia tends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimers disease, generally between the ages of 40 and 45.",1
Frontotemporal dementia care at Mayo Clinic Identifying precisely which diseases fall into the category of frontotemporal dementia presents a particular challenge to scientists.,1
The signs and symptoms may vary greatly from one individual to the next.,1
Researchers have identified several clusters of symptoms that tend to occur together and are dominant in subgroups of people with the disorder.,1
More than one symptom cluster may be apparent in the same person.,1
"The signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia progressively worsen with time, almost always over years.",1
"Eventually, people require 24-hour care.",1
The most common signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia involve extreme changes in behavior and personality.,1
"These include: Increasingly inappropriate actions Loss of empathy and other interpersonal skills Lack of judgment and inhibition Apathy Repetitive compulsive behavior A decline in personal hygiene Changes in eating habits, predominantly overeating Oral exploration and consumption of inedible objects Lack of awareness of thinking or behavioral changes Some subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are marked by the impairment or loss of speech and language difficulties.",1
Two types of primary progressive aphasia are considered frontotemporal dementia.,1
Primary progressive aphasia is characterized by an increasing difficulty in using and understanding written and spoken language.,1
"For example, people may have trouble finding the right word to use in speech or naming objects.",1
Semantic dementia is one type of primary progressive aphasia.,1
Its also known as semantic variant primary progressive aphasia.,1
Individuals with semantic dementia have prominent difficulty naming anomia and may replace a specific word with a more general word such as it for pen.,1
They may also lose knowledge of word meaning.,1
Progressive agrammatic nonfluent aphasia is another type of primary progressive aphasia characterized by nonfluent and hesitant speech.,1
Speech may sound telegraphic with misuse of pronouns and errors in sentence construction.,1
"Rarer subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are characterized by problems with movement, similar to those associated with Parkinsons disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",1
"Movement-related signs and symptoms may include: Tremor Rigidity Muscle spasms Poor coordination Difficulty swallowing Muscle weakness In frontotemporal dementia, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain shrink.",1
"Usually, the cause is unknown.",1
A variety of mutations on several different genes have been linked to specific subtypes of frontotemporal dementia.,1
"However, more than half the people who develop frontotemporal dementia have no family history of dementia.",1
"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is divided into two main subtypes, one involving the accumulation in the brain of a protein called tau and one involving the protein TDP-43.",1
"In some cases, the affected parts of the brain contain microscopic abnormal tau protein-filled structures that develop within brain cells Pick bodies.",1
"Frontotemporal dementia was once known as Picks disease, but now that terminology is reserved for the subtype that actually features these abnormal structures.",1
"Recently, researchers have confirmed shared genetics and molecular pathways between frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS.",1
The importance of these connection is currently under investigation.,1
Your risk of developing frontotemporal dementia is higher if you have a family history of dementia.,1
There are no other known risk factors.,1
"No single test can identify frontotemporal dementia, so doctors attempt to identify certain characteristic features while excluding other possible causes.",1
" The disorder can be especially challenging to diagnose in the early stages, as symptoms of frontotemporal dementia often overlap with those of other conditions.",1
"To see if your symptoms are being caused by a different condition, such as liver or kidney disease, your doctor may order blood tests.",1
Sometimes doctors undertake a more extensive assessment of reasoning and memory skills.,1
This type of testing is especially helpful in determining the type of dementia at an early stage.,1
"By looking at images of the brain, doctors may be able to pinpoint any visible abnormalities ‚ such as clots, bleeding or tumors ‚ that may be causing signs and symptoms.",1
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI.,1
 An MRI machine uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of your brain.,1
Positron emission tomography PET.,1
" PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material thats injected into a vein to help visualize blood sugar metabolism in the brain, which can help identify frontal or temporal lobe brain abnormalities.",1
Frontotemporal dementia cant be cured.,1
There is no effective way to slow its progression.,1
Treatment involves managing the symptoms.,1
 Antidepressants.,1
" Some types of antidepressants, such as trazodone, may reduce the behavioral problems associated with frontotemporal dementia.",1
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs ‚ such as sertraline Zoloft or fluvoxamine Luvox ‚ also have been effective in some people.,1
Antipsychotics.,1
" Antipsychotic medications, such as olanzapine Zyprexa or quetiapine Seroquel, are sometimes used to combat the behavioral problems of frontotemporal dementia.",1
" However, these medications must be used with caution because the side effects include an increased risk of death in dementia patients.",1
 People experiencing language difficulties may benefit from speech therapy to learn alternate strategies for communication.,1
" Youll need to have caregivers as your condition progresses, to assist with daily life activities, maintain your safety, provide transportation and help with finances.",1
" Your doctor will discuss lifestyle changes with you, such as when you may need to stop driving a car.",1
Regular cardiovascular exercise may help improve your mood and thinking skills.,1
"It may be helpful to make some adjustments in your home to make daily living tasks easier and reduce your chance of injuries, such as removing rugs or raising toilets.",1
"In some cases, caregivers can reduce behavior problems by changing the way they interact with people with dementia.",1
"Examples include: Avoiding events or activities that trigger the undesirable behavior Anticipating needs and meeting them promptly Maintaining a calm environment Providing structured routines Simplifying daily tasks Using humor If youve been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, receiving support, care and compassion from people you trust can be invaluable.",1
"Through your doctor or the internet, find a support group for people with frontotemporal dementia.",1
A support group can provide valuable information tailored for your needs as well as a forum that gives you the opportunity to share your experiences and feelings.,1
Caring for someone with frontotemporal dementia can be challenging and stressful because of the extreme personality changes and behavioral problems that often develop.,1
It may be helpful to educate others about behavioral symptoms and what they can expect when spending time with your loved one.,1
"Caregivers need assistance from family members, friends and support groups, or respite care provided by adult care centers or home health care agencies.",1
"Caregivers should remember to take care of their health, exercise, eat a healthy diet and manage their stress.",1
Participating in hobbies outside the home may help ease some stress.,1
"When a person with frontotemporal dementia requires 24-hour care, most families turn to nursing homes.",1
Plans made ahead of time will make this transition easier and may allow the person to be involved in the decision-making process.,1
People with frontotemporal dementia often dont recognize that they have a problem.,1
"In many cases, family members are the ones who notice the symptoms and arrange for a doctors appointment.",1
 Your family doctor may refer you to a doctor trained in nervous system conditions neurologist or mental health conditions psychologist for further evaluation.,1
"Because you may not be aware of all your signs and symptoms, its a good idea to take a family member or close friend along with you to the doctors appointment.",1
"You may also want to take a written list that includes: Detailed descriptions of your symptoms Information about medical conditions youve had in the past Information about medical conditions of your parents or siblings All the medications and dietary supplements you take Questions you want to ask the doctor In addition to a physical exam, your doctor may also check your neurological health by testing your: Reflexes Muscle strength Muscle tone Senses of touch and sight Coordination Balance During the appointment, your doctor might also conduct a brief mental status evaluation, which may assess: Memory Problem-solving abilities Attention span Counting skills Language usage.",1
Frontotemporal dementias as a group are the fourth most common cause of dementia.,1
"In most parts of the United States, among patients younger than 60 years, the frontotemporal dementias are the first or second most common cause of dementia.",1
"In patients older than 60 years, the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer disease begins to take off, with Alzheimer disease becoming by far the most prevalent form of dementia.",1
Pick disease is sometimes used to refer to the clinical phenotype of the frontotemporal dementias.,1
"This group of disorders has a variety of pathologic substrates, the most prevalent of which is frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions.",1
"In one pathologic series, Pick disease itself as defined by the presence of tau-positive, silver staining, cytoplasmic inclusions accounted for only 5% of all cases of frontotemporal dementias.",1
Familial forms of Pick disease may occur more frequently in Europe particularly in Scandinavian nations.,1
"The estimated frequency ranges from 7-43 cases per 100,000 population.",1
"In a study in the Netherlands, the prevalence was 28 per 100,000 persons.",1
"Familial forms of Pick-complex dementias, linked to chromosome arm 17q, may be particularly common in people of Scandinavian origin/descent.",1
It may represent as many as 17% of dementias in this population.,1
More men than women may be affected by Pick disease.,1
"Pick disease occurs in a younger age group than dementia of the Alzheimer type, with peak incidence occurring in individuals aged 55-65 years.",1
"Like most dementias, Pick disease is slowly progressive, leading to increased vocational and personal disability.",1
"However, a small number of people who have behavioral disturbance consistent with the behavioral variant of FTD may not progress‚this has been called the phenocopy variant.",1
"In past studies, slow or no progression occurs only in patients with nonlinguistic symptoms‚none had primary progressive aphasia.",1
Some patients can progress slowly over extremely long periods.,1
"Some may develop artistic or other talents during the course of their dementia, a phenomenon that is perhaps related to disinhibition of creative brain areas.",1
"Musical or artistic tastes also may change eg, the patient may develop a sudden interest in music intended for much younger listeners.",1
"Some patients may be capable of acquiring new knowledge or skills, such as the use of a computer-assisted, simple communication system.",1
This relative sparing of ability to ‚do things‚ process-oriented rather than content-oriented memory may be helpful in implementing behavioral training techniques to optimize social and daily activity competence.,1
"Pick disease runs a shorter course than Alzheimer disease, on average about 6 years.",1
"In some individuals whose main symptoms are a disturbance of speech and language primary progressive aphasia, the clinical course can be slow.",1
"In one small series, these patients survived an average of 5 years longer than patients with behavioral symptoms behavioral variant.",1
A patient with primary progressive aphasia may preserve the ability to function at home for 10 or more years after onset.,1
 Alzheimer disease AD is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive and behavioral impairment that significantly interferes with social and occupational functioning.,1
It is an incurable disease with a long preclinical period and progressive course.,1
"In AD, plaques develop in the hippocampus, a structure deep in the brain that helps to encode memories, and in other areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in thinking and making decisions.",1
Whether plaques themselves cause AD or whether they are a by-product of the AD process remains unknown.,1
The following image depicts one of the cardinal neuroimaging findings in AD ‚ hippocampal atrophy.,1
A patient with preclinical AD may appear completely normal on physical examination and mental status testing.,1
"Specific regions of the brain eg, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus are likely to be affected decades before any signs or symptoms appear.",1
"Signs of mild AD can include the following: Memory loss Confusion about the location of familiar places Taking longer to accomplish normal, daily tasks Trouble handling money and paying bills Compromised judgment, often leading to bad decisions Loss of spontaneity and sense of initiative Mood and personality changes; increased anxiety The symptoms of this stage can include the following: Increasing memory loss and confusion Shortened attention span Problems recognizing friends and family members Difficulty with language; problems with reading, writing, working with numbers Difficulty organizing thoughts and thinking logically Inability to learn new things or to cope with new or unexpected situations Restlessness, agitation, anxiety, tearfulness, wandering, especially in the late afternoon or at night Repetitive statements or movement; occasional muscle twitches Hallucinations, delusions, suspiciousness or paranoia, irritability Loss of impulse control: Shown through behavior such as undressing at inappropriate times or places or vulgar language Perceptual-motor problems: Such as trouble getting out of a chair or setting the table Patients with severe AD cannot recognize family or loved ones and cannot communicate effectively.",1
"They are completely dependent on others for care, and all sense of self seems to vanish.",1
"Other symptoms of severe AD can include the following: Weight loss Seizures, skin infections, difficulty swallowing Groaning, moaning, or grunting Increased sleeping Lack of bladder and bowel control In end-stage AD, patients may be in bed much or all of the time.",1
"Death is often the result of other illnesses, frequently aspiration pneumonia.",1
"All drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA for the treatment of AD are symptomatic therapies that modulate neurotransmitters, either acetylcholine or glutamate.",1
The standard medical treatment for AD includes cholinesterase inhibitors ChEIs and a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA antagonist.,1
 They do not treat the underlying cause of AD nor halt the rate of decline.,1
"The following classes of psychotropic medications have been used to treat the secondary symptoms of AD, such as depression, agitation, aggression, hallucinations, delusions, and sleep disorders : Antidepressants Anxiolytics Antiparkinsonian agents Beta-blockers Antiepileptic drugs Neuroleptics There are no proven modalities for preventing AD, but evidence, largely epidemiologic, suggests that healthy lifestyles can reduce the risk of developing the disease; the following may be protective : Physical activity Exercise Cardiorespiratory fitness Diet: Although no definitive dietary recommendations can be made, in general, nutritional patterns that appear beneficial for AD prevention fit the Mediterranean diet See and for more detail.",1
Alzheimer disease AD is the most common form of dementia.,1
"In the United States alone, approximately 6.08 million Americans had either clinical AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD in 2017.",1
That number is expected to grow to 15 million by 2060.,1
" AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 3.6% of all deaths in 2014.",1
"The percentage of Alzheimer‚ decedents who died in a medical facility e.g., hospital declined from 14.7% in 1999 to 6.6% in 2014, whereas the percentage who died at home increased from 13.9% in 1999 to 24.9% in 2014.",1
"Economically, AD is a major public health problem.",1
Total payments in 2017 for health care and long-term care for all individuals with AD or other dementias are estimated at $259 billion.,1
"By 2050, these costs could rise as high as $1.1 trillion.",1
"Currently, an autopsy or brain biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of AD.",1
"In clinical practice, the diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the history and findings on Mental Status Examination see Presentation.",1
