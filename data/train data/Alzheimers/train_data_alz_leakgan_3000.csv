A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen.,1
Brain changes associated with Alzheimers disease lead to growing trouble with: Everyone has occasional memory lapses.,1
Its normal to lose track of where you put your keys or forget the name of an acquaintance.,1
"But the memory loss associated with Alzheimers disease persists and worsens, affecting the ability to function at work or at home.",1
"People with Alzheimers may: Repeat statements and questions over and over Forget conversations, appointments or events, and not remember them later Routinely misplace possessions, often putting them in illogical locations Get lost in familiar places Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects Have trouble finding the right words to identify objects, express thoughts or take part in conversations Alzheimers disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers.",1
"Multitasking is especially difficult, and it may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time.",1
These difficulties may progress to an inability to recognize and deal with numbers.,1
The ability to make reasonable decisions and judgments in everyday situations will decline.,1
"For example, a person may make poor or uncharacteristic choices in social interactions or wear clothes that are inappropriate for the weather.",1
"It may be more difficult to respond effectively to everyday problems, such as food burning on the stove or unexpected driving situations.",1
"Once-routine activities that require sequential steps, such as planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game, become a struggle as the disease progresses.",1
"Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimers may forget how to perform basic tasks such as dressing and bathing.",1
Brain changes that occur in Alzheimers disease can affect moods and behaviors.,1
"Problems may include the following: Depression Apathy Social withdrawal Mood swings Distrust in others Irritability and aggressiveness Changes in sleeping habits Wandering Loss of inhibitions Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen Many important skills are preserved for longer periods even while symptoms worsen.",1
"Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories and reminiscing, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts.",1
These skills may be preserved longer because they are controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease.,1
"A number of conditions, including treatable conditions, can result in memory loss or other dementia symptoms.",1
"If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your doctor for a thorough assessment and diagnosis.",1
"If you are concerned about thinking skills you observe in a family member or friend, talk about your concerns and ask about going together to a doctors appointment.",1
"Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimers disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time.",1
"Less than 1 percent of the time, Alzheimers is caused by specific genetic changes that virtually guarantee a person will develop the disease.",1
These rare occurrences usually result in disease onset in middle age.,1
"The exact causes of Alzheimers disease arent fully understood, but at its core are problems with brain proteins that fail to function normally, disrupt the work of brain cells neurons and unleash a series of toxic events.",1
"Neurons are damaged, lose connections to each other and eventually die.",1
"The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory, but the process begins years before the first symptoms.",1
The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brains.,1
"By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk significantly.",1
Researchers are focused on the role of two proteins: Plaques.,1
 Beta-amyloid is a leftover fragment of a larger protein.,1
" Although vitamin E isnt effective for preventing Alzheimers, taking 2,000 international units daily may help delay the progression in people who already have the disease.",1
"However, study results have been mixed, with only some showing this benefit.",1
"Further research into the safety of 2,000 international units daily of Vitamin E in a dementia population will be needed before it can be routinely recommended.",1
Supplements promoted for cognitive health can interact with medications youre taking for Alzheimers disease or other health conditions.,1
"Work closely with your health care team to create a safe treatment plan with any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications or dietary supplements.",1
Healthy lifestyle choices promote good overall health and may play a role in maintaining cognitive health.,1
Regular exercise is an important part of a treatment plan.,1
"Activities such as a daily walk can help improve mood and maintain the health of joints, muscles and the heart.",1
Exercise can also promote restful sleep and prevent constipation.,1
People with Alzheimers who develop trouble walking may still be able to use a stationary bike or participate in chair exercises.,1
You may find exercise programs geared to older adults on TV or on DVDs.,1
"People with Alzheimers may forget to eat, lose interest in preparing meals or not eat a healthy combination of foods.",1
"They may also forget to drink enough, leading to dehydration and constipation.",1
Offer the following: Healthy options.,1
 Buy healthy food options that the person with Alzheimers disease likes and can eat.,1
Water and other healthy beverages.,1
 Try to ensure that a person with Alzheimers drinks several glasses of liquids every day.,1
"Avoid beverages with caffeine, which can increase restlessness, interfere with sleep and trigger a frequent need to urinate.",1
"High-calorie, healthy shakes and smoothies.",1
 You can supplement milkshakes with protein powders or make smoothies featuring favorite ingredients.,1
This may be particularly important when eating becomes more difficult.,1
Social interactions and activities can support the abilities and skills that are preserved.,1
Doing things that are meaningful and enjoyable are important for the overall well-being of a person with Alzheimers disease.,1
"These might include: Listening to music or dancing Reading or listening to books Gardening or crafts Social events at senior or memory care centers Planned activities with children People with Alzheimers disease experience a mixture of emotions ‚ confusion, frustration, anger, fear, uncertainty, grief and depression.",1
"If youre caring for someone with Alzheimers, you can help them cope with the disease by being there to listen, reassuring the person that life can still be enjoyed, providing support, and doing your best to help the person retain dignity and self-respect.",1
A calm and stable home environment can help reduce behavior problems.,1
"New situations, noise, large groups of people, being rushed or pressed to remember, or being asked to do complicated tasks can cause anxiety.",1
"As a person with Alzheimers becomes upset, the ability to think clearly declines even more.",1
Caring for a person with Alzheimers disease is physically and emotionally demanding.,1
"Feelings of anger and guilt, stress and discouragement, worry and grief, and social isolation are common.",1
Caregiving can even take a toll on the caregivers physical health.,1
Paying attention to your own needs and well-being is one of the most important things you can do for yourself and for the person with Alzheimers.,1
"If youre a caregiver for someone with Alzheimers, you can help yourself by: Learning as much about the disease as you can Asking questions of doctors, social workers and others involved in the care of your loved one Calling on friends or other family members for help when you need it Taking a break every day Spending time with your friends Taking care of your health by seeing your own doctors on schedule, eating healthy meals and getting exercise Joining a support group Making use of a local adult day center, if possible Many people with Alzheimers and their families benefit from counseling or local support services.",1
"Contact your local Alzheimers Association affiliate to connect with support groups, doctors, occupational therapists, resources and referrals, home care agencies, residential care facilities, a telephone help line, and educational seminars.",1
Medical care for the loss of memory or other thinking skills usually requires a team or partner strategy.,1
"If you are concerned about your memory loss or related symptoms, ask a close relative or friend to go with you to a doctors appointment.",1
"In addition to providing support, your partner can provide help in answering questions.",1
"If you are accompanying someone on a doctors appointment, your role may be to provide some history or your perspective on changes you have observed.",1
This teamwork is an important part of medical care for initial appointments and throughout a treatment plan.,1
"Your primary care doctor may refer you to a neurologist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist or other specialist for further evaluation.",1
You can prepare for your appointment by writing down as much information as possible to share.,1
"Information may include: Medical history, including any past or current diagnoses and family medical history Medical team, including the name and contact information of any current physician, mental health professional or therapist Medications, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbal medications or other dietary supplements Symptoms, including specific examples of changes in memory or thinking skills Your doctor will likely ask a number of the following questions to understand changes in memory or other thinking skills.",1
"If you are accompanying someone to an appointment, be prepared to provide your perspective as needed.",1
Your doctor may ask: What kinds of memory difficulties and mental lapses are you having.,1
When did you first notice them.,1
"Are they steadily getting worse, or are they sometimes better and sometimes worse.",1
"Have you stopped doing certain activities, such as managing finances or shopping, because these activities were too mentally challenging.",1
How is your mood.,1
"Do you feel depressed, sadder or more anxious than usual.",1
Have you gotten lost lately on a driving route or in a situation thats usually familiar to you.,1
Reye syndrome facts Reye syndrome is a rare and severe illness that affects children.,1
Reye syndrome is associated with viral infection and aspirin use.,1
Reye syndrome causes vomiting and mental-status changes .,1
Diagnosing Reye syndrome primarily depends on the clinical history of symptoms.,1
"The most common abnormal laboratory tests with Reye syndrome include elevated liver enzymes , elevated ammonia levels, and low serum glucose levels.",1
"Treatment is supportive, and even with treatment, severe Reye syndrome results in permanent brain damage and death.",1
"Since educating parents about the dangers of aspirin use, the incidence of Reye syndrome has decreased markedly.",1
What is Reye syndrome.,1
3 Reye syndrome is a rare but often severe and even fatal illness that primarily occurs in children and adolescents.,1
Children diagnosed with Reye syndrome generally present with vomiting and mental-status changes.,1
The illness can resolve spontaneously or progress to coma and death.,1
"Although the cause is still unclear, studies have identified that there is a relationship between some viral infections and the use of aspirin medications.",1
"The CDC recommended educating parents about the dangers of treating children with aspirin in the 1980s, and now the disease occurs very rarely.",1
"In 1963, Dr.",1
Ralph Douglas Reye initially described the syndrome.,1
What causes Reye syndrome.,1
"Although there has been extensive research into the cause of Reye syndrome, medical professionals still do not completely understand it.",1
"As mentioned above, the use of aspirin or aspirin-containing medications to treat children with some viral infections, including chickenpox , influenza , and gastroenteritis , is associated with the development of the disease.",1
"Ultimately, the causes of symptoms associated with Reye syndrome relate to dysfunction of the liver and a resultant increase in serum ammonia levels and other toxins.",1
"These toxins cause increased pressure in the brain and swelling, leading to brain dysfunction and can progress to death.",1
What are risk factors for Reye syndrome.,1
Most children diagnosed with Reye syndrome have a history of a recent viral infection.,1
"Health care providers identify chickenpox and influenza most often, though they have also described rotavirus a cause of bowel inflammation or gastroenteritis.",1
"In addition to the recent viral infection, most have a history of taking aspirin to control fever .",1
"Some researchers have suggested that children with undiagnosed metabolic disorders may also be at risk, though this is not completely clear.",1
What are Reye syndrome symptoms and signs.,1
The primary symptoms of Reye syndrome include uncontrolled vomiting and mental-status changes.,1
These symptoms are generally the result of increased intracranial pressure and brain swelling.,1
"If untreated and progressive, the disease is fatal.",1
"Even if physicians identify and treat it early, some patients will still have progressive disease resulting in death or permanent brain damage.",1
How do health care professionals diagnose Reye syndrome.,1
"Doctors consider a diagnosis of Reye syndrome in any child who has unexplained brain dysfunction encephalopathy , vomiting, and liver dysfunction.",1
A history of a recent viral infection and aspirin use certainly supports the diagnosis.,1
"In general, laboratory studies that reveal a prominent blood acidosis and an increase in liver enzymes and ammonia levels and marked decreases in serum glucose hypoglycemia are supportive of the diagnosis.",1
"However, it should be noted that other metabolic disorders can have with similar symptoms.",1
There are reports of undiagnosed metabolic diseases that may be associated with a patient having Reye syndrome-type physical findings and metabolic derangements.,1
Medical professionals describe these patients as having Reye-like syndrome.,1
What is the treatment for Reye syndrome.,1
"1 Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for Reye syndrome.",1
"Primarily, the treatment aims to decrease the effects of the metabolic dysfunction.",1
Health care providers admit patients with Reye syndrome to an intensive care unit where doctors who specialize in the care of critically ill children can manage them.,1
"In this setting, they can be monitored for a worsening neurologic and metabolic condition.",1
The primary goal is to manage electrolyte imbalances and brain swelling.,1
"It is difficult to predict which patients will have a progressive illness, however some recommend using medications aimed at lowering the serum ammonia level ammonia is one cause of increased brain swelling.",1
"In addition, in some cases of progressive and resistant Reye syndrome, physicians have used hemodialysis to remove toxins believed to be partly responsible for the brain swelling.",1
What is the prognosis for Reye syndrome.,1
There is significant variation in outlook amongst children diagnosed with Reye syndrome.,1
It is dependent upon the severity and progression of the disease.,1
"Some children may have mild disease and completely recover, and others may develop permanent dysfunction of the brain or die from the disease.",1
"In general, children diagnosed and treated early in the course of the illness have better outcomes.",1
Studies also suggest that those presenting with high ammonia levels have a worse prognosis.,1
Is it possible to prevent Reye syndrome.,1
"Although we do not know how to prevent Reye syndrome, we do know that reducing aspirin use in children has resulted in a decrease in the incidence of the illness.",1
"In 1980, there were over 500 cases of Reye syndrome in the United States, and now there are only one to two cases per year.",1
"The United Kingdom has seen similar statistics, as well.",1
Health officials attribute this remarkable reduction to the cessation of aspirin use in patients less than 18 years of age.,1
It is important to note that several over-the-counter products contain aspirin or aspirin-like compounds.,1
Pepto-Bismol is such an example.,1
There is a separate product without aspirin-like compounds available.,1
What is the latest research on Reye syndrome.,1
Most research focuses on understanding what the triggers are for Reye syndrome and how aspirin is involved in the disease.,1
"In addition, some are trying to determine why some patients progress rapidly and some cases simply resolve.",1
Where can I find more information about Reye syndrome.,1
Frontotemporal dementia Picks disease facts* * Frontotemporal dementia Picks disease facts medical author: William C.,1
"Shiel Jr., MD, FACP, FACR Frontotemporal dementia FTD, or Picks disease, is a syndrome featuring shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain.",1
"The symptoms of frontotemporal dementia fall into two clinical patterns that involve either: 1 changes in behavior, or 2 problems with language.",1
Frontotemporal dementia is often inherited and runs in families.,1
There is no treatment for frontotemporal dementia and treatment is directed toward minimizing symptoms.,1
Frontotemporal dementia progresses steadily and often rapidly and is fatal.,1
The duration of disease ranges from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others What is frontotemporal dementia Picks disease.,1
Frontotemporal dementia FTD describes a clinical syndrome associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain.,1
"Originally known as Picks disease, the name and classification of frontotemporal dementia has been a topic of discussion for over a century.",1
"The current designation of the syndrome groups together Picks disease, primary progressive aphasia , and semantic dementia as frontotemporal dementia.",1
Some doctors propose adding corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy to frontotemporal dementia and calling the group Pick Complex.,1
These designations will continue to be debated.,1
What are the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia.,1
"5 As it is defined today, the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia fall into two clinical patterns that involve either 1 changes in behavior, or 2 problems with language.",1
"The first type features behavior that can be either impulsive disinhibited or bored and listless apathetic and includes inappropriate social behavior; lack of social tact; lack of empathy; distractability; loss of insight into the behaviors of oneself and others; an increased interest in sex; changes in food preferences; agitation or, conversely, blunted emotions; neglect of personal hygiene; repetitive or compulsive behavior, and decreased energy and motivation.",1
"The second type primarily features symptoms of language disturbance, including difficulty making or understanding speech, often in conjunction with the behavioral types symptoms.",1
Spatial skills and memory remain intact.,1
Is frontotemporal dementia inherited.,1
There is a strong genetic component to the disease; frontotemporal dementia often runs in families.,1
Is there any treatment for frontotemporal dementia.,1
4 No treatment has been shown to slow the progression of frontotemporal dementia.,1
Behavior modification may help control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors.,1
"Aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors could require medication.",1
Antidepressants have been shown to improve some symptoms.,1
What is the prognosis the outlook for frontotemporal dementia.,1
1 The outcome for people with frontotemporal dementia is poor.,1
"The disease progresses steadily and often rapidly, ranging from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others.",1
Eventually some individuals with frontotemporal dementia will need 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in an institutionalized care setting.,1
What research is being done on frontotemporal dementia.,1
"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH, conduct research related to frontotemporal dementia in laboratories at the NIH, and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.",1
 Reye syndrome is characterized by acute noninflammatory encephalopathy and fatty degenerative liver failure.,1
The syndrome was first described in 1963 in Australia by RDK Reye and described a few months later in the United States by GM Johnson.,1
Cases with identical manifestations were described as early as 1929.,1
"In the United States, Reye syndrome became a reportable disease in 1973.",1
Peak incidence was reported in 1979-80.,1
"Reye syndrome typically occurs after a viral illness, particularly an upper respiratory tract infection, , , or , and is associated with the use of aspirin during the illness.",1
"A dramatic decrease in the use of aspirin among children, in combination with the identification of medication reactions, toxins, and IEMs that present with Reye syndrome‚like manifestations, have made the diagnosis of Reye syndrome exceedingly rare.",1
"With the recognition that Reye syndrome is rare, this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis in any child with vomiting and altered mental status and classic laboratory findings.",1
A high index of suspicion is essential.,1
"Given that manifestations of Reye syndrome are not unique to Reye syndrome but also are seen in a growing list of conditions, and given that no test is specific for Reye syndrome, the diagnosis must be one of exclusion.",1
All children with manifestations suggestive of Reye syndrome should be tested for IEM.,1
"Early recognition and treatment of Reye and Reye-like syndromes, including presumptive treatment for possible IEM See is essential to prevent death and optimize the likelihood of recovery without neurologic impairment.",1
"Some have suggested the term Reye syndrome or Reye-like syndrome should be used to describe clinical manifestations of diseases states regardless of etiology, while causes still without a known etiology after diagnostic workup should be referred to as Reye disease.",1
"The pathogenesis of Reye syndrome, while not precisely elucidated, appears to involve mitochondrial injury resulting in dysfunction that disrupts oxidative phosphorylation and fatty-acid beta-oxidation in a virus-infected, sensitized host potentially with an underlying occult inborn error of fatty acid oxidation, urea cycle or mitochondrial disorder.",1
"The host has usually been exposed to mitochondrial toxins, most commonly salicylates >80% of cases.",1
"Histologic changes include cytoplasmic fatty vacuolization in hepatocytes, astrocyte edema and loss of neurons in the brain, and edema and fatty degeneration of the proximal lobules in the kidneys.",1
"All cells have pleomorphic, swollen mitochondria that are reduced in number, along with glycogen depletion and minimal tissue inflammation.",1
"Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction results in hyperammonemia, which is thought to induce astrocyte edema, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure ICP.",1
Influenza virus types A and B and varicella-zoster virus are the pathogens most commonly associated with Reye syndrome.,1
"Other pathogens include parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, measles, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, retrovirus, hepatitis virus types A and B, mycoplasma, chlamydia, pertussis, shigella, salmonella, and polio.",1
Reye has occurred after immunization with live viral vaccines.,1
"The association of Reye syndrome with salicylates, particularly aspirin, was demonstrated in several epidemiologic studies around the world.",1
"Less than 0.1% of children who took aspirin developed Reye syndrome, but more than 80% of patients diagnosed with Reye syndrome had taken aspirin in the past 3 weeks.",1
"A causal relation between Reye syndrome and salicylates has not been definitively established and has been questioned on the basis of biases and limitations in the studies, but recommendations by government health agencies that children not be treated with salicylates led to an immediate and dramatic decrease in the incidence of Reye syndrome.",1
Results of in vitro studies are contradictory on impact of aspirin on beta-oxidation metabolism.,1
One study demonstrated that salicylates decrease beta-oxidation of the long-chain fatty acid palmitate by cultured fibroblasts from children who recovered from Reye syndrome as compared with control subjects.,1
"Another study showed that in two different cell lines, aspirin increased mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation, did not change oxidation of medium chain fatty acids, and inhibited peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, which suggest that aspirin impairs long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria.",1
"Some have postulated that salicylates stimulate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS because of the findings of iNOS stimulation in African children with fatal malaria, a disease that causes symptoms similar to those of Reye syndrome and is often treated with aspirin.",1
Recognition of the structural similarity between aspirin metabolites and enzyme substrates for the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme important in beta-oxidation led to identification of the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase LCHAD component of the enzyme as the target of salicylate inhibition.,1
Absence of inhibition of beta-oxidation by salicylates in fibroblasts from patients with LCHAD deficiency substantiated the finding.,1
"Acetaminophen, outdated tetracycline, valproic acid, warfarin, zidovudine didanosine, and some neoplastic drugs have been associated with Reye syndrome or Reye-like syndrome.",1
"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including sodium diclofenac and mefenamic acid, are thought to produce or worsen Reye syndrome.",1
"An association with antiemetics, such as phenothiazines, has been postulated but not substantiated.",1
"An association with acetaminophen was reported but has been refuted, although there may be a synergistic effect of acetaminophen and salicylates.",1
"Reye syndrome or Reye-like syndrome may also be associated with insecticides; herbicides; aflatoxins; isopropyl alcohol; paint; paint thinner; margosa neem oil; hepatotoxic mushrooms; Jamaican vomiting sickness; and herbal medications with atractyloside, a diterpenoid glycoside found in the extracts of the tuber of impila poisoning.",1
cereulide toxin has also been reported as producing Reye syndrome.,1
"IEMs that produce Reye-like syndromes include fatty-acid oxidation defects, particularly medium-chain acyl dehydrogenase MCAD and long-chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiency LCAD inherited and acquired forms, urea-cycle defects, amino and organic acidopathies, primary carnitine deficiency, and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism.",1
"Undoubtedly, other IEMs that cause Reye-like syndrome will be identified.",1
The percentage of patients with a previous diagnosis of Reye syndrome is 0.4%.,1
The percentage of patients who have a sibling with a Reye syndrome history is 2.9%.,1
It is likely that at least of some of these patients had an IEM rather than Reye syndrome.,1
"IEMs may account for the heterogeneity of disease manifestations in patients younger than 5 years who have received a diagnosis of Reye syndrome, especially those younger than 1 year.",1
The possibility that IEMs are more likely than true Reye syndrome in patients younger than 5 years may also explain why decreases in salicylate use and decreases in the incidence of Reye syndrome have been greatest in patients older than 5 years.,1
"IEM is suggested by recurrence of symptoms, precipitating factors, including prolonged fasting, changes in diet, decompensation out of proportion to intercurrent illnesses, failure to thrive, neurologic abnormalities, neurologic dysfunction, and family members with similar symptoms and/or unexplained infant deaths.",1
"In the United States, national surveillance for Reye syndrome began in 1973.",1
"It is believed that before the 1970s, most of the cases that met the criteria for Reye syndrome were diagnosed as encephalitis or drug intoxication.",1
The peak annual incidence of 555 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC was in 1979-1980.,1
"Between December 1, 1980, and November 30, 1997, 1207 cases of Reye syndrome in patients younger than 18 years were reported.",1
"During that period, the incidence was 0.15-0.88 cases per 100,000 children per year and as high as 6 cases per 100,000 during regional outbreaks of influenza.",1
"Side effects include indigestion , diarrhea , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting , muscle cramps , and fatigue .",1
Memantine Namenda is another type of drug approved for the treatment of AD.,1
Possible side effects include agitation and anxiety .,1
"Other medicines may be needed to control aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors.",1
These are usually administered in very low doses.,1
It may be necessary to discontinue the use of any medications that make confusion worse.,1
"Such medicines may include painkillers , cimetidine , central nervous system depressants , antihistamines , sleeping pills, and others.",1
Never change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your doctor.,1
"Supplement therapy Many people take folate vitamin B9 , vitamin B12 , and vitamin E .",1
"However, there is no strong evidence that taking these vitamins prevents AD or slows the progression of the disease once it occurs.",1
Some people believe that the herb ginkgo biloba can prevent or slow the development of dementia .,1
"However, rigorous studies have failed to show that ingesting this herb lowers a persons odds of developing dementia .",1
Do not use ginkgo if you take blood-thinning medications like warfarin Coumadin or a class of antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAOIs .,1
"If you are considering taking any drugs or supplements, you should talk to your doctor first.",1
Remember that herbs and supplements available over the counter are not regulated by the FDA.,1

"Directions to Hospitals Treating Alzheimers disease Prevention Although there is no proven way to prevent AD , there are some practices that may be worth incorporating into your daily routine, particularly if you have a family history of dementia .",1
"Talk to your doctor before implementing any of these approaches, especially those that involve taking a medication or supplement .",1
Consume a low-fat diet .,1
"Eat cold-water fish like tuna, salmon, and mackerel rich in omega-3 fatty acids at least 2 to 3 times per week.",1
"Reduce your intake of linoleic acid , which is found in margarine, butter, and dairy products.",1
"Increase consumption of antioxidants like carotenoids , vitamin E , and vitamin C by eating plenty of darkly colored fruits and vegetables.",1
Maintain a normal blood pressure .,1
Stay mentally and socially active throughout your life.,1
"Consider taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs like ibuprofen Advil, Motrin, sulindac Clinoril, or indomethacin Indocin.",1
"Statins , a class of medications normally used for the treatment of high cholesterol , may help lower your risk of AD.",1
Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of using these medications for preventive purposes.,1
"In addition, early testing of a vaccine against AD is currently underway.",1
The trajectory of AD is different for each person.,1
"If AD develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly.",1
"Patients with AD often die earlier than normal, although a patient may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after being diagnosed.",1
The final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years.,1
"During that time, the patient becomes immobile and totally disabled.",1
"Picks disease is a rare and permanent form of dementia that is similar to Alzheimers disease , except that it tends to affect only certain areas of the brain.",1
What are the symptoms of Picks disease.,1
The disease gets worse slowly.,1
Tissues in the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain start to shrink over time .,1
"Symptoms such as behavior changes, speech difficulty, and impaired thinking occur slowly, but continue to get worse.",1
The early personality changes can help doctors tell Picks disease apart from Alzheimer‚ .,1
"Memory loss is often the main, and earliest, symptom of Alzheimers.",1
People with Picks disease tend to behave the wrong way in different social settings.,1
The changes in behavior continue to get worse and are often one of the most disturbing symptoms of the disease.,1
"Some patients will have more prominent difficulty with decision making, complex tasks, or language trouble finding or understanding words or writing.",1
General symptoms are listed below.,1
"Behavioral changes: Cant keep a job Compulsive behaviors Inappropriate behavior Inability to function or interact in social or personal situations Problems with personal hygiene Repetitive behavior Withdrawal from social interaction Emotional changes: Abrupt mood changes Decreased interest in daily living activities Failure to recognize changes in behavior Failure to show emotional warmth, concern, empathy, sympathy Inappropriate mood Not caring about events or environment Language changes: Cant speak mutism Decreased ability to read or write Difficulty finding a word Difficulty speaking or understanding speech aphasia Repeat anything spoken to them echolalia Shrinking vocabulary Weak, uncoordinated speech sounds Neurological problems: Increased muscle tone rigidity Memory loss that gets worse Movement/coordination difficulties apraxia Weakness Other problems: Urinary incontinence What causes Picks disease.",1
People with Picks disease have abnormal substances called Pick bodies and Pick cells inside nerve cells in the damaged areas of the brain.,1
Pick bodies and Pick cells contain an abnormal form of a protein called tau.,1
This protein is found in all nerve cells.,1
But some people with Picks disease have an abnormal amount or type of this protein.,1
The exact cause of the abnormal form of the protein is unknown.,1
Many different abnormal genes have been found that can cause Pick‚ disease.,1
Many cases of Picks disease are passed down through families.,1
Picks disease is rare.,1
"It can occur in people as young as 20, but usually begins between ages 40 and 60.",1
The average age at which it begins is 54.,1
When to seek urgent medical care.,1
Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of Picks disease.,1
Call your health care provider or go to the emergency room if mental function gets worse which may mean that another disorder has developed.,1
Diagnosis The doctor will ask you about your medical history and symptoms.,1
"Your health care provider might order tests to help rule out other causes of dementia , including dementia due to metabolic causes.",1
"Picks disease is tentatively diagnosed based on symptoms and results of tests, including: Assessment of the mind and behavior neuropsychological assessment Brain MRI Electroencephalogram EEG Examination of the brain and nervous system neurological exam Examination of the fluid around the central nervous system cerebrospinal fluid after a lumbar puncture Head CT scan Tests of sensation, thinking and reasoning cognitive function, and motor function A brain biopsy is the only test that can confirm the diagnosis .",1
Treatment options There is no specific treatment for Picks disease.,1
"Certain antidepressants and antipsychotics may help manage mood swings related to Picks disease, but further research is needed.",1
"Sometimes patients with Picks take the same medications used to treat other types of dementia , such as medications that decrease the breakdown of the chemical messenger , acetylcholine anticholinesterase inhibitors , and memantine .",1
"However, there is no conclusive evidence that these help.",1
"In some cases, stopping or changing medications that worsen confusion or that are not essential can improve thinking and other cognitive functions.",1
This may include medications such as: Analgesics Anticholinergics Central nervous system depressants Cimetidine Lidocaine Its important to treat any disorders that contribute to confusion .,1
These may include: Anemia Decreased oxygen hypoxia levels Heart failure High carbon dioxide levels Infections Kidney failure Liver failure Nutritional disorders Thyroid disorders Psychiatric conditions such as depression Treating any medical and psychiatric disorders often helps improve mental function .,1
"Medications may be needed to control aggressive, dangerous, or agitated behaviors.",1
"Some patients may benefit from hearing aids, glasses, cataract surgery , or other treatments.",1
Behavior modification can help some people control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors.,1
This consists of rewarding appropriate or positive behaviors and ignoring inappropriate behaviors when its safe to do so.,1
"Formal psychotherapy treatment doesnt always work, because it can cause further confusion or disorientation.",1
"Reality orientation , which reinforces environmental and other cues, may help reduce disorientation.",1
"Depending on the symptoms and severity of the disease, the patient may need monitoring and help with personal hygiene and self-care .",1
"Eventually, there may be a need for 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in a special facility.",1
Family counseling can help the person cope with the changes needed for home care.,1
Care may include: Adult protective services Community resources Homemakers Visiting nurses or aides Volunteer services People may need legal advice early in the course of the disorder .,1
"Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions can make it easier to make ethical decisions regarding the care of the person with Picks disease.",1
Where to find medical care for Picks disease.,1
Directions to Hospitals Treating Picks disease What to expect Outlook/Prognosis.,1
The disorder quickly and steadily becomes worse.,1
Patients become totally disabled early in the course of the disease.,1
"Picks disease commonly causes death within 2 - 10 years , usually from infection but sometimes from general failure of the body systems.",1
Possible complications Abuse by an over-stressed caregiver Infection Loss of ability to care for self or perform normal activities Loss of ability to interact with others Progressive loss of ability to function Side effects of medications used to treat the disorder Reduced life span Prevention There is no known prevention.,1
