Bone cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor of the bone that destroys normal bone tissue .,0
Not all bone tumors are malignant.,0
"In fact, benign (noncancerous) bone tumors are more common than malignant ones.",0
"Both malignant and benign bone tumors may grow and compress healthy bone tissue, but benign tumors do not spread, do not destroy bone tissue, and are rarely a threat to life.",0
Malignant tumors that begin in bone tissue are called primary bone cancer.,0
"Cancer that metastasizes (spreads) to the bones from other parts of the body, such as the breast, lung, or prostate, is called metastatic cancer, and is named for the organ or tissue in which it began.",0
Primary bone cancer is far less common than cancer that spreads to the bones.,0
Cancer can begin in any type of bone tissue. or fiber supplements.,0
"Bones are made up of osteoid (hard or compact), cartilaginous (tough, flexible), and fibrous (thread like) tissue, as well as elements of bone marrow (soft, spongy tissue in the center of most bones).",0
"Common types of primary bone cancer include: Osteosarcoma, which arises from osteoid tissue in the bone.",0
This tumor occurs most often in the knee and upper arm .,0
"Chondrosarcoma, which begins in cartilaginous tissue.",0
Cartilage pads the ends of bones and lines the joints.,0
"Chondrosarcoma occurs most often in the pelvis (located between the hip bones), upper leg, and shoulder",0
Sometimes a chondrosarcoma contains cancerous bone cells.,0
"In that case, doctors classify the tumor as an osteosarcoma.",0
"The Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFTs), which usually occur in bone but may also arise in soft tissue (muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, or other supporting tissue).",0
Scientists think that ESFTs arise from elements of primitive nerve tissue in the bone or soft tissue .,0
ESFTs occur most commonly along the backbone and pelvis and in the legs and arms .,0
Other types of cancer that arise in soft tissue are called soft tissue sarcomas.,0
They are not bone cancer and are not described in this resource.,0
(More information about these types of cancer is available in the NCI fact sheet Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Questions and Answers at ,0
Primary bone cancer is rare.,0
It accounts for much less than 1 percent of all cancers.,0
"About 2,300 new cases of primary bone cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year .",0
Different types of bone cancer are more likely to occur in certain populations: Osteosarcoma occurs most commonly between ages 10 and 19.,0
"However, people over age 40 who have other conditions, such as Paget disease (a benign condition characterized by abnormal development of new bone cells), are at increased risk of developing this cancer.",0
Chondrosarcoma occurs mainly in older adults (over age 40).,0
The risk increases with advancing age.,0
This disease rarely occurs in children and adolescents.,0
ESFTs occur most often in children and adolescents under 19 years of age.,0
Boys are affected more often than girls.,0
These tumors are extremely rare in African American children.,0
"Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer, but not all bone cancers cause pain .",0
Persistent or unusual pain or swelling in or near a bone can be caused by cancer or by other conditions. fatigue and weakness .,0
It is important to see a doctor to determine the cause. and TSHR genes may be involved in the causes of congenital hypothyroidism.,0
"Although bone cancer does not have a clearly defined cause, researchers have identified several factors that increase the likelihood of developing these tumors.",0
Osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in people who have had high-dose external radiation therapy or treatment with certain anticancer drugs; children seem to be particularly susceptible.,0
A small number of bone cancers are due to heredity.,0
"For example, children who have had hereditary retinoblastoma (an uncommon cancer of the eye) are at a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, particularly if they are treated with radiation",0
"Additionally, people who have hereditary defects of bones and people with metal implants, which doctors sometimes use to repair fractures, are more likely to develop osteosarcoma .",0
"Ewing sarcoma is not strongly associated with any heredity cancer syndromes, congenital childhood diseases, or previous radiation exposure ",0
"Diagnosis To help diagnose bone cancer, the doctor asks about the patient’s personal and family medical history.",0
The doctor also performs a physical examination and may order laboratory and other diagnostic tests.,0
"These tests may include : X-rays, which can show the location, size, and shape of a bone tumor.",0
"If x-rays suggest that an abnormal area may be cancer, the doctor is likely to recommend special imaging tests.",0
"Even if x-rays suggest that an abnormal area is benign, the doctor may want to do further tests, especially if the patient is experiencing unusual or persistent pain",0
"A bone scan, which is a test in which a small amount of radioactive material is injected into a blood vessel and travels through the bloodstream; it then collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.",0
"A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan, which is a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles, that are created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine.",0
"A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure, which uses a powerful magnet linked to a computer to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body without using x-rays.",0
"A positron emission tomography (PET) scan, in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is used.",0
"Because cancer cells often use more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body.",0
"An angiogram, which is an x-ray of blood vessels.",0
Biopsy (removal of a tissue sample from the bone tumor) to determine whether cancer is present.,0
The surgeon may perform a needle biopsy or an incisional biopsy.,0
"During a needle biopsy, the surgeon makes a small hole in the bone and removes a sample of tissue from the tumor with a needle-like instrument. and TSHR genes result in congenital hypothyroidism.",0
"In an incisional biopsy, the surgeon cuts into the tumor and removes a sample of tissue.",0
Biopsies are best done by an orthopedic oncologist (a doctor experienced in the treatment of bone cancer) .,0
A pathologist (a doctor who identifies disease by studying cells and tissues under a microscope) examines the tissue to determine whether it is cancerous.,0
Blood tests to determine the level of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase.,0
"A large amount of this enzyme is present in the blood when the cells that form bone tissue are very active—when children are growing, when a broken bone is mending, or when a disease or tumor causes production of abnormal bone tissue",0
"Because high levels of alkaline phosphatase are normal in growing children and adolescents, this test is not a completely reliable indicator of bone cancer (1, 6)",0
"Treatment options Treatment options depend on the type, size, location, and stage of the cancer, as well as the person’s age and general health",0
"Treatment options for bone cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and cryosurgery.",0
Surgery is the usual treatment for bone cancer.,0
The surgeon removes the entire tumor with negative margins (no cancer cells are found at the edge or border of the tissue removed during surgery).,0
The surgeon may also use special surgical techniques to minimize the amount of healthy tissue removed with the tumor.,0
Dramatic improvements in surgical techniques and preoperative tumor treatment have made it possible for most patients with bone cancer in an arm or leg to avoid radical surgical procedures (removal of the entire limb).,0
"However, most patients who undergo limb-sparing surgery need reconstructive surgery to maximize limb function .",0
Chemotherapy is the use of anticancer drugs to kill cancer cells.,0
Patients who have bone cancer usually receive a combination of anticancer drugs.,0
"However, chemotherapy is not currently used to treat chondrosarcoma .",0
"Radiation therapy, also called radiotherapy, involves the use of high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells",0
This treatment may be used in combination with surgery.,0
"It is often used to treat chondrosarcoma, which cannot be treated with chemotherapy, as well as ESFTs ",0
It may also be used for patients who refuse surgery.,0
Cryosurgery is the use of liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill cancer cells.,0
This technique can sometimes be used instead of conventional surgery to destroy the tumor .,0
"Directions to Hospitals Treating Bone cancer Prevention Bone cancer sometimes metastasizes, particularly to the lungs, or can recur (come back), either at the same location or in other bones in the body . and salmon).",0
People who have had bone cancer should see their doctor regularly and should report any unusual symptoms right away.,0
Follow-up varies for different types and stages of bone cancer.,0
"Generally, patients are checked frequently by their doctor and have regular blood tests and x-rays.",0
"People who have had bone cancer, particularly children and adolescents,have an increased likelihood of developing another type of cancer, such as leukemia, later in life",0
Regular follow-up care ensures that changes in health are discussed and that problems are treated as soon as possible.,0
Are clinical trials (research studies) available for people with Bone cancer.,0
"Participation in clinical trials is an important treatment option for many people with bone cancer. cheese, palm oil, coconut oil, trans fats, hydrogenated oils, lard, and shortening).",0
"To develop new treatments and better ways to use current treatments, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a part of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring clinical trials in many hospitals and cancer centers around the country.",0
Clinical trials are a critical step in the development of new methods of treatment.,0
"Before any new treatment can be recommended for general use, doctors conduct clinical trials to find out whether the treatment is safe for patients and effective against the disease. resulting in a 5% to 7% weight loss can delay and possibly prevent type 2 diabetes.",0
People interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk with their doctor.,0
"Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI’s Cancer Information Service (CIS) (see below) at 1–800–4–CANCER and in the NCI booklet Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Research Studies, which can be found at ",0
This booklet describes how research studies are carried out and explains their possible benefits and risks.,0
Further information about clinical trials is available at ,0
"The Web site offers detailed information about specific ongoing studies by linking to PDQ®, the NCI’s comprehensive cancer information database.",0

"An osteoma is a benign (noncancerous) bone tumor that usually develops in the paranasal sinus and facial bones, such as mastoid bone, frontal and maxillary sinus",0
"Although osteomas can cause pain and discomfort, they do not spread throughout the body.",0
Osteomas can affect people of all ages but they occur more frequently adults.,0
Osteomas are usually asymptomatic.,0
"However if symptoms occur, common symptoms can be dull, aching facial pain",0
"In some cases, a person will suffer from facial deformity before seeing a doctor for diagnosis.",0
Who is at highest risk.,0
There are no known risk factors for osteoma.,0
Diagnosis Regular self-examinations are key to early detection of osteoma.,0
"Any time a bulk deformity appears, go to see a ENT specialist.",0
"Diagnosis of osteoma is incidental, but sometimes CT scan and x-ray can be useful.",0
When to seek urgent medical care.,0
"Call your ENT specialist if symptoms of osteoma, such as facial deformity, vision loss, and anosmia develop.",0
Treatment Options Patients osteoma have a single treatment option.,0
The selection depends on the symptoms generated by the tumor.,0
The option is elective surgery.,0
"Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities.",0
Surgery is the main treatment for most cases of osteoma.,0

Resources Canadian Cancer Society: Benign tumours of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.,0
"There are three types of bone cancer: Osteosarcoma - develops in growing bones, usually between ages 10 and 25 Chondrosarcoma - starts in cartilage, usually after age 50 Ewing's sarcoma - begins in nerve tissue in bone marrow of young people, often after treatment of another condition with radiation or chemotherapy Osteosarcoma is the most common type of malignant bone cancer, accounting for 35% of primary bone malignancies",0
There is a preference for the metaphyseal region of tubular long bones.,0
50% of cases occur around the knee.,0
It is a malignant connective (soft) tissue tumor whose neoplastic cells present osteoblastic differentiation and form tumoral bone.,0
"Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, and may have been occurring for some time.",0
"If the tumour is large, it can appear as a swelling.",0
The affected bone is not as strong as normal bones and may fracture with minor trauma (a pathological fracture).,0
"Bone fracture (may occur after what seems like a routine movement) Bone pain Limitation of motion Limping (if the tumor is in the leg) Pain when lifting (if the tumor is in the arm) Tenderness , swelling , or redness at the site of the tumor Who is at highest risk",0
Age and height: Data suggest that the risk of osteosarcoma is highest during the teenage growth spurt.,0
Children with osteosarcoma are usually tall for their age.,0
Radiation to bones: People who were treated with radiation for another cancer have a higher risk of later developing post-radiation (after radiation) osteosarcoma.,0
Certain bone diseases: Some bone diseases such as Paget disease of bone and multiple hereditary osteochondromas may be risk factors of osteosarcoma.,0
Inherited cancer syndromes: Syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and retinoblastoma may increase the risk of developing osteosarcoma.,0
"These tests may include : X-rays , which can show the location, size, and shape of a bone tumor.",0

This technique can sometimes be used instead of conventional surgery to destroy the tumor  .,0
"Directions to Hospitals Treating Bone cancer Prevention of Osteosarcoma Currently, there are no known modifications to one's lifestyle that will help prevent bone cancer.",0
The prognosis for bone cancer varies immensely based on how far the cancer has spread in the body and what specific type of cancer it is.,0
"You should talk to your doctor about your specific condition and outlook to gain a better sense of your prognosis. and other body organs (diabetic neuropathy) Stroke Worsening of eyesight or blindness due to diabetic retinopathy (eye disease) Other complications include: Erection problems Infections of the skin, female genital tract, and urinary tract Prevention Researchers are making progress in identifying the exact genetics and triggers that predispose some individuals to develop type 1 diabetes, but prevention remains elusive.",0
"A chondrosarcoma is a type of bone cancer , which occurs when normal cells in bone cartilage become abnormal and start to replicate at a very rapid rate.",0
Chondrosarcomas can occur as part of a benign tumor that is also present. and other areas in your body.,0
Most types of chondrosarcomas grow slowly and do not spread to other areas of the body.,0
The symptoms of chondrosarcoma usually include pain and swelling in the area of the tumor .,0
"The pain can be intermittent, but overall it usually gets worse over time.",0
"The pain can get worse with exercise, or at night.",0
The symptoms can also include a painful hard lump over the area of the disease.,0
"If the chondrosarcoma is in the skull bone, it can cause headaches.",0
"Although the actual exact cause of chondrosarcoma is not known, there is thought to be certain genetic components that make chondrosarcoma more likely in certain individuals.",0
Chondrosarcoma has also been seen to occur more frequently in persons who have had radiation therapy for other cancers.,0
Chondrosarcoma may arise from pervious benign cartilage tumors.,0
"Some of these tumors are: Enchondromas - a type of benign bone tumor that often occurs in the hands, but can also occur in other sites of the body.",0
Osteochondromas - benign tumors that arise near the growth plate of the bone.,0
Multiple exostoses - multiple overgrowths of cartilage that occur at the end of the growth plate.,0
Ollier's disease - a disease causing multiple enchondromas.,0
Maffucci's syndrome - a disease with multiple enchondromas and angiomas.,0
Diagnosis All diagnosis always involves the doctor taking a history and doing a physical examination .,0
"If chondrosarcoma is suspected, then an x-ray will then be done of the bone that may be diseased.",0
"Other tests may be done to confirm the diagnosis, such as a CT scan or an MRI .",0
A biopsy may also be done where a sample of the diseased bone tissue is taken and looked at under a microscope.,0
Treatment options The goal in treating chondrosarcoma is to remove the mass and to reduce the chance of it recurring.,0
"Treatments consist of surgery to remove the tumor, physical therapy to gain back strength and optimize the use of the limb after surgery, and chemotherapy ",0
Radiation therapy may also be required if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.,0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Chondrosarcoma Prevention of Chondrosarcoma Preventing radiation exposure is a preventative measure for chondrosarcoma.,0
"Grading and staging of the tumor by your doctor with the use of biopsy, can help to determine your prognosis with the disease.",0
"Possible complications Chondrosarcoma may return, and may need treatment with surgery , chemotherapy or radiation ",0
Congenital heart disease refers to a problem with the heart's structure and function due to abnormal heart development before birth.,0
Symptoms depend on the specific condition.,0
"While congenital heart disease is present at birth, the symptoms may not be immediately obvious for e.g.",0
coarctation of the aorta may not cause problems for many years.,0
"Also, a small ventricular septal defect (VSD), may never cause any problems, and some people with a VSD have normal physical activity and a normal life span.",0
Congenital heart disease is often divided into two types: cyanotic (blue discoloration caused by a relative lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic .,0
The common causes of congenital heart diseases are: Cyanotic : Tetralogy of Fallot Transposition of the great vessels Tricuspid atresia Total anomalous pulmonary venous return Truncus arteriosus Hypoplastic left heart Pulmonary atresia Some forms of total anomalous pulmonary venous return Ebstein's anomaly Non-cyanotic : Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Atrial septal defect (ASD) Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) Aortic stenosis Pulmonic stenosis Coarctation of the aorta Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect) These problems may occur alone or together.,0
The majority of congenital heart diseases occurs as an isolated defect and is not associated with other diseases.,0
"However, they can also be a part of various genetic and chromosomal syndromes such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Noonan syndrome",0
"Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems.",0
Individuals at an increased risk for congenital heart disease include: People with a family history of congenital heart disease Babies born to mothers who: Drink during pregnancy Use recreational drugs Use certain prescriptions and over-the-counter medications dangerous to fetal development Fail to get proper prenatal care When to seek urgent medical care.,0
Call your health care provider if you suspect that your child has a heart problem.,0
Diagnosis The health care provider will take a careful history and perform a complete physical examination primarily focusing on the examination of heart.,0
Tests : Ultrasound in case of pregnant women Echocardiography (ultrasound of heart) for children and adults Treatment options Treatment depends on the specific condition.,0
"Some congenital heart diseases can be treated with medication alone, while others require one or more surgeries.",0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Congenital heart disease What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
How well a patient does depends on the specific defect.,0
Possible complications Complications depend on the specific condition and treatment.,0
"Prevention Although the cause of many congenital heart diseases are complex, care during pregnancy can greatly influence the outcome of the developing fetus.",0
Expectant mothers should take care to: Avoid alcohol and other drugs during pregnancy.,0
Doctors should be made aware that a woman is pregnant before prescribing any medications for her.,0
A blood test should be done early in the pregnancy to see if the woman is immune to rubella.,0
"If the female is not immune, she must avoid any possible exposure to rubella and should be immunized immediately following delivery.",0
"Proper control of Diabetes in pregnant females (as diabetes during pregnancy is a risk factor for developing congenital heart disease) Some prescription, over-the-counter medications and street drugs used during pregnancy increase the risk of heart defects.",0
"Genetics does appear to play a role in many diseases, and multiple family members may be affected.",0
Talk to your health care provider about screening.,0
Receive good prenatal care.,0
Many congenital defects can be discovered on routine ultrasound examinations performed by an obstetrician.,0
"The delivery can then be anticipated and the appropriate medical personnel (such as a pediatric cardiologist, a cardiothoracic surgeon, and a neonatologist) can be present, and ready to help as necessary.",0
Such preparation can mean the difference between life and death for some babies.,0
Heart block is a problem that occurs with the heart's electrical system.,0
This system controls the rate and rhythm of heartbeats.,0
(Rate refers to the number of times your heart beats in a minute.,0
"Rhythm refers to the pattern of regular or irregular pulses produced when the heart beats over time.) With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper to the lower chambers.",0
"As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood .",0
This process repeats with each new heartbeat .,0
Heart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart .,0
Symptoms depend on the type of heart block you have.,0
First-degree heart block rarely causes symptoms.,0
Symptoms of second- and third-degree heart block include: Chest pain Dizziness Fainting Fatigue Heart failure symptoms Light-headedness Pre-syncope Shortness of breath Syncope What causes Heart block.,0
Heart block has many causes.,0
"Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired).",0
"Congenital Heart Block One form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus .",0
People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.,0
"In pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta.",0
(The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.,0
Congenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block.,0
These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth.,0
"Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.",0
Acquired Heart Block Many factors can cause acquired heart block.,0
Examples include: Damage to the heart from a heart attack.,0
This is the most common cause of acquired heart block.,0
"Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease.",0
"Myocarditis , or inflammation of the heart muscle.",0
Heart failure.,0
Rheumatic fever .,0
"Cardiomyopathy , or heart muscle diseases.",0
Sarcoidosis Degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease .,0
Certain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block.,0
"Exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicines - including digitalis , beta blockers , and calcium channel blockers - also may cause heart block ",0
Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems.,0
Some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes ).,0
An overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block.,0
You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body.,0
These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen.,0
Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.,0
"In some cases, acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved.",0
"For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.",0
"Also, if a medicine is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered",0
Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines.,0
The risk factors for congenital and acquired heart block are different.,0
"Congenital Heart Block If a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus , her fetus is at risk for heart block",0
Autoimmune diseases can cause the body to make proteins called antibodies that can cross the placenta .,0
(The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These antibodies may damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block .,0
Congenital heart defects also may result in congenital heart block.,0
"Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes these defects.",0
Heredity may play a role in certain heart defects.,0
"For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child with the condition.",0
Acquired Heart Block Acquired heart block can occur in people of any age.,0
"However, most types of the disorder are more common in older people.",0
This is because many of the risk factors are more common in older people.,0
People who have a history of heart disease or heart attacks are more likely to have heart block.,0
"Examples of heart disease that can lead to heart block include heart failure , coronary heart disease , and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle diseases)",0
Other diseases also may raise the risk of heart block.,0
These include sarcoidosis and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease .,0
"Exposure to toxic substances or taking certain medicines, such as digitalis , also can raise your risk of heart block",0
Well-trained athletes and young people are at higher risk for first-degree heart block caused by an overly active vagus nerve .,0
Diagnosis Heart block may be diagnosed as part of a routine doctor's visit or during an emergency situation.,0
"(Third-degree heart block often is an emergency.) Your doctor will diagnose heart block based on your family and medical histories, a physical exam, and results from tests such as: EKG (Electrocardiogram): Doctors usually use a test called an EKG (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block",0
An EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular).,0
The test also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.,0
Holter Monitors: A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical signals for a full 24- or 48-hour period.,0
You wear one while you do your normal daily activities.,0
This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG.,0
Event Monitors: An event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor.,0
You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities.,0
"However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.",0
"Electrophysiology Study: For some cases of heart block, doctors may do electrophysiology studies (EPS).",0
"During this test, a thin, flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin (upper thigh) or arm to your heart",0
The wire records your heart's electrical signals.,0
"If you are experiencing the above mentioned symptoms for the first time or are severe, call 9–1–1 or have someone drive you to the hospital emergency room.",0
"If you have milder symptoms, talk with your doctor right away to find out whether you need prompt treatment.",0
Treatment options Treatment depends on the type of heart block you have.,0
First-degree heart block usually needs no treatment.,0
"If you have second-degree heart block , you may need a pacemaker.",0
A pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen.,0
This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.,0
"If you have third-degree heart block , you will need a pacemaker.",0
"In an emergency, a temporary pacemaker may be used until you can get a long-term device.",0
Most people who have third-degree heart block need pacemakers for the rest of their lives.,0
Some people who have third-degree congenital heart block don't need a pacemaker for many years.,0
Others may need a pacemaker at a young age or during infancy.,0
"If a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease , such as lupus , her fetus is at risk for heart block ",0
"If heart block is detected in a fetus, the mother may be given medicine to reduce the fetus' risk of developing serious heart block.",0
Sometimes acquired heart block goes away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved.,0
"Also, if a medicine is causing heart block, the condition may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered",0
"Medications to avoid Patients diagnosed with second-degree atrioventricular block and third-degree atrioventricular block should avoid using the following medications: Amiodarone Propafenone Timolol If you have been diagnosed with second-degree atrioventricular block and third-degree atrioventricular block, consult your physician before starting or stopping any of these medications.",0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Heart Block What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
First-degree heart block may not cause any symptoms or require treatment.,0
"If you have second-degree heart block that doesn't require a pacemaker , talk with your doctor about keeping your heart healthy.",0
Your doctor will tell you whether you need ongoing care for your condition.,0
People who have third-degree heart block and some people who have second-degree heart block need pacemakers.,0
"If you have a pacemaker, you should take special care to avoid things that may interfere with it.",0
Avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices and devices that have strong magnetic fields.,0
These objects can keep your pacemaker from working properly.,0
"Let all of your doctors, dentists, and medical technicians know that you have a pacemaker",0
You also should notify airport screeners.,0
Your doctor can give you a card that states what kind of pacemaker you have.,0
Carry this card in your wallet.,0
You may want to consider wearing a medical ID bracelet or necklace that states that you have a pacemaker.,0
Certain medical procedures can disrupt pacemakers.,0
"Examples include MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), electrocauterization during surgery, and shock-wave lithotripsy to get rid of kidney stones ",0
Your doctor may need to check your pacemaker several times a year to make sure it's working well.,0
"Some pacemakers must be checked in the doctor's office, but others can be checked over the phone.",0
Ask your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you.,0
A pacemaker usually won't limit you from doing sports and physical activity.,0
"But you may need to avoid full-contact sports, such as football, that can damage the pacemaker",0

"An arrhythmia is a disorder of the heart rate , pulse , or heart rhythm , such as beating too fast ( tachycardia ), too slow ( bradycardia ), or irregularly.",0
"When you have an arrhythmia, your heartbeat may be: Too slow ( bradycardia ) Too quick ( tachycardia ) Irregular, uneven or skipping beats An arrhythmia may be present all of the time or it may come and go",0
You may or may not feel symptoms when the arrhythmia is present.,0
"Or, you may only notice symptoms when you are more active.",0
"Symptoms can be very mild, or they may be severe or even life-threatening.",0
"Common symptoms that may occur when the arrhythmia is present include: Chest pain Fainting Light-headedness , dizziness Paleness Shortness of breath Sweating What causes cardiac arrhythmia.",0
"Normally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.To help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way",0
The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node).,0
This is your heart's natural pacemaker.,0
The signal leaves the SA node and travels though the heart along a set electrical pathway.,0
Different nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster.,0
Arrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system.,0
"Abnormal extra signals may occur Electrical signals may be blocked or slowed Electrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart Some common causes of abnormal heartbeats are: Abnormal levels of potassium or other substances Heart attack , or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) Heart failure or an enlarged heart Overactive thyroid gland Arrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including: Alcohol, caffiene, or stimulants such as amphetamines Beta-blockers Cigarette smoking Drugs that mimic the activity of the nervous system Medications used for depression or psychosis Sometimes anti-arrhythmic medications prescribed to treat one type of arrhythmia will cause another type of arrhythmia",0
Some of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are: Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) Multifocal atrial tachycardia Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia Heart block or atrioventricular block Sick sinus syndrome Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Who is at highest risk.,0
Risk factors for cardiac arrhythmia include: Hypertension or high blood pressure Previous heart surgery Congenital heart disease Thyroid problems Drugs and certain supplements Obesity Diabetes Obstructive sleep apnea Drinking too much alcohol Caffeine and nicotine use Electrolyte imbalances Diagnosis The doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope and feel your pulse.,0
Your blood pressure may be low or normal.,0
"Heart monitoring devices are often used to identify the rhythm problem, such as a: Holter monitor (used for 24 hours) Event monitor or loop recorder (worn for 2 weeks or longer Other tests may be done to look at heart function: Coronary angiography EKG (electrocardiogram) Echocardiogram A special test, called an electrophysiology study (EPS), is done to take a closer look at the heart's electrical system.",0
"Call your health care provider if: You develop any of the symptoms of a possible arrhythmia You have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia and your symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment Treatment options When an arrhythmia is serious, you may need urgent treatment to restore a normal rhythm.",0
"This may include: Electrical shock therapy (defibrillation or cardioversion) Implanting a short-term heart pacemaker Medications given through a vein (intravenous) or by mouth Sometimes, getting better treatment for your angina or heart failure will decrease the chance of having an arrhythmia.",0
Medications called anti-arrhythmic drugs may be used: To prevent an arrhythmia from happening again To keep your heart rate from becoming too fast or too slow Some of these medicines can have side effects.,0
Take them as prescribed by your health care provider.,0
Do not stop taking the medicine or change the dose without first talking to your health care provider.,0
"Other treatments to prevent or treat abnormal heart rhythms include: Cardiac ablation used to destroy areas in your heart that may be causing your heart rhythm problems An implantable cardiac defibrillator is placed in people who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death Pacemaker , a device that senses when your heart is beating irregularly, too slowly, or too fast.",0
It sends a signal to your heart that makes your heart beat at the correct pace.,0
Prevention Taking steps to prevent coronary artery disease may reduce your chance of developing an arrhythmia.,0
"The outcome depends on several factors: The kind of arrhythmia -- some arrhythmias may be life threatening if not treated right away, or do not respond well to treatment Whether you have coronary artery disease , heart failure , or valvular heart disease Possible complications Possible complications of having an arrhythmia include stroke and heart failure .",0

Brugada syndrome is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm.,0
"Specifically, this disorder can lead to uncoordinated electrical activity in the heart 's lower chambers ( ventricles ), an abnormality called ventricular arrhythmia ",0
"If untreated, the irregular heartbeats can cause fainting ( syncope ), seizures , difficulty breathing, or sudden death ",0
These complications typically occur when an affected person is resting or asleep.,0
"Brugada syndrome usually becomes apparent in adulthood, although signs and symptoms, including sudden death, can occur any time from early infancy to old age.",0
The mean age of sudden death is approximately 40 years.,0
"This condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of death in babies younger than one year.",0
"It is characterized by sudden and unexplained death, usually during sleep.",0
"Sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) is a condition characterized by unexpected cardiac arrest in young adults, usually at night during sleep.",0
"This condition was originally described in Southeast Asian populations, where it is a major cause of death.",0
Researchers have determined that SUNDS and Brugada syndrome are the same disorder.,0
Mutations in the SCN5A gene cause Brugada syndrome.,0
Mutations in the SCN5A gene have been identified in fewer than one-third of people with Brugada syndrome.,0
"This gene provides instructions for making a sodium channel , which normally transports positively charged sodium atoms (ions) into heart muscle cells.",0
This type of ion channel plays a critical role in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm.,0
"Mutations in the SCN5A gene alter the structure or function of the channel, which reduces the flow of sodium ions into cells. and rice).",0
"A disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, leading to the abnormal heart rhythm characteristic of Brugada syndrome.",0
"In affected people without an identified SCN5A mutation, the cause of Brugada syndrome is often unknown.",0
"In some cases, certain drugs may cause a nongenetic (acquired) form of the disorder.",0
"Drugs that can induce an altered heart rhythm include medications used to treat some forms of arrhythmia , a condition called angina (which causes chest pain ), high blood pressure , depression , and other mental illnesses",0
"Abnormally high blood levels of calcium ( hypercalcemia ) or potassium ( hyperkalemia ), as well as unusually low potassium levels ( hypokalemia ), also have been associated with acquired Brugada syndrome",0
"In addition to causing a nongenetic form of this disorder, these factors may trigger symptoms in people with an underlying SCN5A mutation.",0
"This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.",0
"In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.",0
Other cases may result from new mutations in the gene.,0
These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.,0
Diagnosis The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome relies on the findings of the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and electophysiologic studies.,0
Patients with Brugada syndrome should immediately be transported to the hospital if they suffer from cardiac arrest.,0
"Patients should seek medical care when there are symptoms such as syncope , seizures , or shortness of breath ",0
Treatment options Implantation of a cardiac defibrillator is the only proven method of treatment in Brugada syndrome.,0
Asymptomatic patients who cannot be induced by electrophysiologic studies and those with no family history of Brugada syndrome can be followed-up closely.,0
"Medications to avoid Patients diagnosed with brugada syndrome should avoid using the following medications: Propafenone If you have been diagnosed with brugada syndrome, consult your physician before starting or stopping any of these medications.",0

Interrupted aortic arch is a rare cyanosis congenital heart disease with absence or discontinuation of a portion of the aortic arch.,0
It is thought to be a result of faulty development of the aortic arch system during the fifth to seventh week of fetal development.,0
This condition leads oxygen-rich blood pumped out of the heart cannot reach the lower body and legs normally.,0
"Instead, the descending aorta is connected to the pulmonary artery by a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus.",0
The cause of interrupted aortic arch is thought to gene mutation.,0
"Usual signs and symptoms include rapid breathing, fast heart rate, weakness or fatigue , and poor feeding.",0
Tests such as echocardiography and chest x-ray can show the enlarged right ventricle in patients.,0
Treatments include medicines and surgery.,0
The prognosis of interrupted aortic arch depends on the effect of surgery.,0
The signs and symptoms of interrupted aortic arch depend on the site of the arch interruption.,0
Usual symptoms include: Cyanosis Rapid breathing Fast heart rate Weakness or fatigue Poor feeding Other health problems may also cause these symptoms.,0
"Like many congenital heart disease, the cause of interrupted aortic arch is not clear.",0
Clinical surveys and basic research suggest that the gene mutation may play an important role during the pregnancy.,0
"Call your health care provider if your baby has interrupted aortic arch and symptoms do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms appear.",0
"If your baby experiences either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible: Sudden shortness of breath Cyanosis Diagnosis Echocardiography : Echocardiography is the most commonly used imaging technique for the diagnosis of interrupted aortic arch.",0
"It can demonstrate the site of arch interruption, the size and anatomic type of the ventricular septal defect, the morphology of the aortic valve, and the anatomic severity of subaortic hypoplasia.",0
Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter monitoring : Electrocardiogram and Holter monitoring can tell electric activities of the heart for cardiovascular diseases.,0
"They can supply informations about heart rhythm and indirectly, heart size.",0
Patients with interrupted aortic arch may show right ventricular hypertrophy sign.,0
Chest x-ray : An x-ray image of chest allows the doctor to check the size and shape of the heart to determine whether the heart is enlarged or not.,0
Patients with interrupted aortic arch may show an enlarged heart or an increased pulmonary vascularity.,0
Patient with interrupted aortic arch may reveal the site of the arch interruption and determine whether it affects other blood vessels in the child's body.,0
"Cardiac catheterization can reveal the site of arch interruption, the size and anatomic type of ventricular septal defect, and the anatomic severity of subaortic hypoplasia",0
It can also demonstrate whether the right subclavian artery is aberrant or not.,0
Treatment options Treatments for patients with interrupted aortic arch are medicines and surgery.,0
The goal of medicines is to stabilize and support the infant until surgical intervention to reconnect the aortic arch to create a continuous tube and close the ventricular septal defect.,0
"Before treatment starts, talk to your child's doctor about treatment options and your family's preferences on treatment decisions.",0
Medicines : Medicines such as prostaglandin and diuretics are used before surgery.,0
Prostaglandin is administered intravenously and keeps the ductus arteriosus open.,0
Diuretic therapy help the infant urinate excess fluid.,0
There are some other drugs used to correct abnormal blood gases and supply nutrition for the baby.,0
"Surgery : During the surgery, the anesthetist gives medicine to make the child sleepy and comfortable.",0
"Then the surgeons make a small cut between the ribs to reach the aorta arch and connect the two separate portions of the aorta, close the ventricular septal defect, and tie off the patent ductus arteriosus",0
Complications after surgery may include residual obstruction or stenosis at the aortic repair site.,0
"During the following peroid, the child needs to have a long-term follow-up by the cardiologist to assess growth of the aortic valve region and the reconstructed aortic arch.",0

Tricuspid atresia is a type of congenital heart disease in which the tricuspid heart valve is missing or abnormally developed.,0
The defect blocks blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle .,0
What are the symptoms of Tricuspid atresia.,0
Patients with ventricular septal defects may not have symptoms.,0
"However, if the hole is large, the baby often has symptoms related to heart failure ",0
The most common symptoms include: Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin) Easily fatigued Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ) Fast breathing ( tachypnea ) Poor growth What causes Tricuspid atresia.,0
"Tricuspid atresia is an uncommon form of congenital heart disease that affects about 5 in every 100,000 live births.",0
20% of patients with this condition will also have have other heart problems.,0
"Normally, blood flows from the body into the right atrium , then through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and on to the lungs",0
"If the tricuspid valve does not open, the blood cannot flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle.",0
"Blood ultimately cannot enter the lungs, where it must go to pick up oxygen (become oxygenated).",0
Infants with tricuspid atresia generally are cyanotic (bluish discoloration of skin) and easily become short of breath .,0
"As with all congenital heart diseases , families with a history of tricuspid atresia run a higher risk of passing it onto their children.",0
Other potential factors include access to prenatal care and the mother's behavior during pregnancy (i.e.,0
"alcohol consumption , illicit drug use, etc)",0
"If your infant has new changes in breathing patterns, eats less (decreased feeding), or has skin or mucous membranes that are turning blue ( cyanotic ), contact your health care provider immediately.",0
Diagnosis This condition may be discovered during routine prenatal ultrasound imaging or when the baby is examined shortly after birth.,0
Cyanosis is present from birth.,0
A heart murmur is often present at birth and may increase in loudness over several months.,0
"Tests may include the following: ECG Echocardiogram Chest x-ray Cardiac catheterization MRI of the heart Treatment options Once the diagnosis is made, the baby will be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ).",0
A breathing machine ( ventilator ) may be needed to help the baby breathe.,0
A medicine called prostaglandin E1 is used to maintain circulation of blood to the lungs.,0
The condition always requires surgery.,0
"If the heart is unable to pump enough blood out to the lungs and rest of the body, the first surgery usually occurs within the first few days of life.",0
"In this procedure, an artificial shunt is inserted to maintain blood flow to the lungs.",0
"In some cases, this first surgery is not necessary.",0
"Afterwards, the baby usually goes home.",0
"The child will need to take one or more daily medicines and be closely followed by a pediatric cardiologist , who will determine when the second stage of surgery should be done.",0
Stage II of the operation is called the Glenn shunt or Hemifontan procedure.,0
This procedure connects half of the veins carrying blue blood from the upper half of the body directly to the pulmonary artery .,0
The surgery is usually done when the child is between 4 - 6 months of age.,0
"During stage I and II, the child may still appear somewhat blue ( cyanotic ).",0
"Stage III, the final step, is called the Fontan procedure ",0
"The remainder of the veins carrying blue blood from the body is connected directly to the pulmonary artery leading to the lungs, and the left ventricle now only has to pump to the body and no longer the lungs.",0
This surgery is usually performed between the ages of 18 months and 3 years of age.,0
"After this final step, the baby is no longer blue ( cyanotic ).",0
Some patients may need more surgeries in their 20s or 30s if they develop hard to control arrhythmias or other complications of the Fontan procedure .,0
"In a few hospitals, heart transplantation is considered to be a better alternative to the 3-step surgery process, but there are few donated hearts available for small infants",0
Where to find medical care for Tricuspid atresia.,0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Tricuspid atresia What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
Improvement can be expected with most surgical procedures.,0
Unexpected death may occur with heart arrhythmias .,0
"Possible complications Irregular, fast heart rhythms ( arrhythmias ) Chronic diarrhea (from a disease called protein losing enteropathy ) Heart failure Fluid in the abdomen ( ascites ) and in the lungs ( pleural effusion ) Blockage of the artificial shunt Strokes and other neurological complications Sudden death Prevention There is no known way to prevent tricuspid atresia.",0
Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition that affects blood flow from the heart to the lungs in some babies who have structural problems of the heart.,0
"Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) Bluish lips, fingers, toes, and skin (cyanosis) Chest pain Coughing up blood Dizziness Fainting Feeling tired Shortness of breath Stroke Swelling in the joints caused by too much uric acid (gout) What causes Eisenmenger's syndrome.",0
Eisenmenger syndrome is caused by a defect in the heart.,0
"Most often, babies with this condition are born with a hole between the two pumping chambers -- the left and right ventricles -- of the heart (ventricular septal defect).",0
"The hole allows blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body.",0
"Other heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include: Atrioventricular canal defect Atrial septal defect Cyanotic heart disease Patent ductus arteriosus Truncus arteriosus Over time, increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs.",0
This causes high blood pressure in the lungs.,0
"As a result, the blood backs up and does not go to the lungs to pick up oxygen.",0
"Instead, the blood goes from the right side to the left side of the heart, allowing oxygen-poor blood to travel to the rest of the body",0
Eisenmenger syndrome usually develops before a child reaches puberty.,0
"However, it also can develop in young adulthood.",0
"Like most congenital heart defects, it is unclear exactly why certain babies are born with Eisenmenger's syndrome.",0
Genetic testing may be performed to assist you in estimating the likelihood that any future children may be born with Eisenmenger's syndrome.,0
"During pregnancy, expectant mothers exposed to rubella may have an increased risk in having a baby with a heart defect.",0
Drug and alcohol exposure during pregnancy can also harm the fetus during development and result in potential birth defects.,0
When to seek medical care for Eisenmenger's syndrome Call your health care provider if your infant develops symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome.,0
Diagnosis The doctor will examine the child.,0
"During the exam, the doctor may find: Enlarged fingers and toes (clubbing) Heart murmur (an extra sound when listening to the heart) The doctor will diagnose Eisenmenger syndrome by looking at the patient’s history of heart problems.",0
"Tests may include: Complete blood count (CBC) Chest x-ray MRI scan of the heart Putting a thin tube in an artery to view the heart and blood vessels and measure pressures (cardiac catheterization) Test of the electrical activity in the heart (electrocardiogram) Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) The number of cases of this condition in the United States has dropped because doctors are now able to diagnose and correct the defect sooner, before the irreversible damage to the small lung arteries occurs.",0
"Treatment options Older children with symptoms may have blood removed from the body (phlebotomy) to reduce the number of red blood cells, and then receive fluids to replace the lost blood (volume replacement).",0
"Children may receive oxygen, although it is unclear whether it helps to prevent the disease from getting worse.",0
Children with very severe symptoms may need a heart-lung transplant.,0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Eisenmenger's syndrome What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
"How well the infant or child does depends on whether another medical condition is present, and the age at which high blood pressure develops in the lungs.",0
Patients with this condition can live 20 to 50 years.,0
Possible Complications Bleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain Congestive heart failure Gout Heart attack Hyperviscosity (sludging of the blood because it is too thick with blood cells) Infection (abscess) in the brain Kidney failure Poor blood flow to the brain Stroke Sudden death Prevention Surgery as early as possible to correct the heart defect can prevent Eisenmenger syndrome.,0
"Truncus arteriosus is a rare type of heart disease that occurs at birth (congenital heart disease), in which a single blood vessel (truncus arteriosus) comes out of the right and left ventricles, instead of the normal two vessels (pulmonary artery and aorta)",0
There are different types of truncus arteriosus.,0
"Bluish skin (cyanosis) Delayed growth or growth failure Fatigue Lethargy Poor feeding Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Widening of the finger tips (clubbing) What causes Persistent truncus arteriosus . having a bowel movement, or kicking his or her legs upon awakening.",0
"In normal circulation, the pulmonary artery comes out of the right ventricle and the aorta comes out of the left ventricle, which are separate from each other",0
Coronary arteries (which supply blood to the heart muscle) come out of the aorta just above the valve at the entrance of the aorta.,0
"In truncus arteriosus, a single artery comes out of the ventricles.",0
There is usually also a large hole between the two ventricles (ventricular septal defect).,0
"As a result, the blue (without oxygen) and red (oxygen-rich) blood mix.",0
"Some of this mixed blood goes to the lungs, some goes to the coronary arteries, and the rest goes to the body",0
"Usually, too much blood is sent to the lungs.",0
"If this condition is not treated, two problems occur: Too much blood circulation in the lungs may cause extra fluid to build up in and around them, making it difficult to breathe",0
The blood vessels to the lungs become permanently damaged.,0
"Over time, it becomes very hard for the heart to force blood to them.",0
This is called pulmonary hypertension and it can be life-threatening.,0
"Call your health care provider if your infant or child: Appears lethargic Appears overly tired or mildly short of breath Does not eat well Does not seem to be growing or developing normally If the skin, lips, or nail beds look blue or if the child seems to be very short of breath, take the child to the emergency room or have the child examined promptly.",0
Diagnosis A murmur is usually heard when listening to the heart with a stethoscope.,0
Tests include: ECG Echocardiogram Heart catheterization (only needed in rare cases to help with the diagnosis or in planning a treatment strategy) MRI of the heart X-ray of the chest Treatment options Surgery is needed to treat this condition.,0
The surgery creates two separate arteries.,0
Usually the truncal vessel is kept as the new aorta.,0
A new pulmonary artery is created using tissue from another source.,0
The branch pulmonary arteries are sewn to this new artery.,0
The hole between the ventricles is closed.,0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Persistent truncus arteriosus What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
Complete repair usually provides good results.,0
Another procedure may be needed as the patient grows.,0
"Untreated cases result in death, often during the first year of life.",0
"Possible complications Heart failure High blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) with pulmonary obstructive lung disease Prevention There is no known prevention, but early treatment can often prevent serious complications.",0
Transposition of the great vessels is a congenital heart defect in which the two major vessels that carry blood away from the heart the aorta and the pulmonary artery are switched (transposed).,0
Blueness of the skin Clubbing of the fingers or toes Poor feeding Shortness of breath What causes Transposition of the great vessels.,0
The cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown.,0
Transposition of the great vessels is a cyanotic heart defect.,0
This means there is decreased oxygen in the blood that is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body.,0
Low blood oxygen leads to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin) and shortness of breath.,0
"In normal hearts, blood that returns from the body goes through the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery to the lungs to get oxygen.",0
The blood then comes back to the left side of the heart and travels out the aorta to the body.,0
"In transposition of the great vessels, the blood goes to the lungs, picks up oxygen, and then goes right back to the lungs without ever going to the body.",0
Blood from the body returns to the heart and goes back to the body without ever picking up oxygen in the lungs.,0
Symptoms appear at birth or very soon afterward.,0
How bad the symptoms are depends on the type and size of heart defects (such as atrial septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus) and how much oxygen moves through the body's general blood flow.,0
The condition is the second most common cyanotic heart defect.,0
Factors in the mother that may increase the risk of this condition include: Age over 40 Alcoholism Diabetes Poor nutrition during pregnancy (prenatal nutrition) Rubella or other viral illness during pregnancy When to seek urgent medical care.,0
"Most often, this condition is diagnosed during routine examination.",0
This condition can also be diagnosed before birth using a fetal echocardiogram.,0
"If not, it is usually diagnosed soon after a baby is born.",0
"Call your infant's health care provider if the baby seems to be having difficulty breathing, if your baby's skin develops a bluish color, especially in the face or trunk",0
or if the baby seems to have an unusual number of respiratory infections.,0
"Contact your health care provider if your baby has this condition and new symptoms develop, get worse, or continue after treatment",0
Diagnosis The health care provider may detect a heart murmur while listening to the chest with a stethoscope.,0
The baby's mouth and skin will be a blue color.,0
"Tests often include the following: Cardiac catheterization Chest x-ray ECG Echocardiogram (if done before birth, it is called a fetal echocardiogram) Pulse oximetry (to check blood oxygen level) Treatment options The baby will immediately receive a medicine called prostaglandin through an IV (intravenous line).",0
"This medicine helps keep the ductus arteriosus open, allowing some mixing of the two blood circulations.",0
A procedure using cardiac catheterization (balloon atrial septostomy) may be needed to create a large hole in the atrial septum to allow blood to mix.,0
A surgery called an arterial switch procedure is used to permanently correct the problem within the baby's first week of life.,0
This surgery switches the great arteries back to the normal position and keeps the coronary arteries attached to the aorta.,0
Where to find medical care for Transpostion of the great vessels.,0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Transposition of the great vessels What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
The child's symptoms will improve after surgery to correct the defect.,0
Most infants who undergo arterial switch do not have symptoms after surgery and live normal lives.,0
"If corrective surgery is not performed, the life expectancy is months.",0
"Possible Complications Arrhythmias Coronary artery problems Heart valve problems Prevention Except for the case of heart-attack-associated VSD, this condition is always present at birth.",0
Drinking alcohol and using the antiseizure medicines depakote and dilantin during pregnancy have been associated with increased incidence of VSDs.,0
"Other than avoiding these things during pregnancy, there is no known way to prevent a VSD.",0
Ventricular septal defect describes one or more holes in the wall that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart.,0
Ventricular septal defect is one of the most common congenital (present from birth) heart defects.,0
It may occur by itself or with other congenital diseases.,0
What are the symptoms of Ventricular septal defect.,0
"However, if the hole is large, the baby often has symptoms related to heart failure",0
The most common symptoms include: Shortness of breath Fast breathing Hard breathing Paleness Failure to gain weight Fast heart rate Sweating while feeding Frequent respiratory infections What causes Ventricular septal defect.,0
"Before a baby is born, the right and left ventricles of its heart are not separate.",0
"As the fetus grows, a wall forms to separate these two ventricles.",0
"If the wall does not completely form, a hole remains.",0
"This hole is known as a ventricular septal defect, or a VSD.",0
Ventricular septal defect is one of the most common congenital heart defects.,0
"The baby may have no symptoms, and the hole can eventually close as the wall continues to grow after birth.",0
"If the hole is large, too much blood will be pumped to the lungs, leading to heart failure",0
The cause of VSD is not yet known.,0
This defect often occurs along with other congenital heart defects.,0
"In adults, ventricular septal defects are a rare but serious complication of heart attacks .",0
These holes are related to heart attacks and do not result from a birth defect.,0
"Like most congenital heart defects, it is unclear exactly why certain babies are born with atrial septal defects .",0
Genetic testing may be performed to assist you in estimating the likelihood that any future children may be born with an atrial septal defect.,0
"During pregnancy, drug and alcohol exposure can also harm the fetus during development and result in potential birth defects.",0
Diagnosis Listening with a stethoscope usually reveals a heart murmur (the sound of the blood crossing the hole).,0
The loudness of the murmur is related to the size of the defect and amount of blood crossing the defect.,0
"Tests may include: Chest x-ray -- looks to see if there is a large heart with fluid in the lungs ECG -- shows signs of an enlarged left ventricle Echocardiogram -- used to make a definite diagnosis Cardiac catheterization (rarely needed, unless there are concerns of high blood pressure in the lungs) MRI of the heart -- used to find out how much blood is getting to the lungs Treatment options If the defect is small, no treatment is usually needed",0
"However, the baby should be closely monitored by a health care provider to make sure that the hole eventually closes properly and signs of heart failure do not occur.",0
Babies with a large VSD who have symptoms related to heart failure may need medicine to control the symptoms and surgery to close the hole.,0
Medications may include digitalis (digoxin) and diuretics .,0
"If symptoms continue despite medication, surgery to close the defect with a Gore-tex patch is needed.",0
"Some VSDs can be closed with a special device during a cardiac catheterization , although this is infrequently done.",0
Surgery for a VSD with no symptoms is controversial.,0
This should be carefully discussed with your health care provider.,0
When to seek medical care.,0
"Most often, this condition is diagnosed during routine examination of an infant.",0
"Call your infant's health care provider if the baby seems to be having difficulty breathing , or if the baby seems to have an unusual number of respiratory infections.",0
Many small defects will close on their own.,0
"For those defects that do not spontaneously close, the outcome is good with surgical repair.",0
Complications may result if a large defect is not treated.,0
"Possible Complications Heart failure Infective endocarditis (bacterial infection of the heart) Aortic insufficiency (leaking of the valve that separates the left ventricle from the aorta) Damage to the electrical conduction system of the heart during surgery (causing arrhythmias ) Delayed growth and development ( failure to thrive in infancy) Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) leading to failure of the right side of the heart Prevention Except for the case of heart-attack-associated VSD, this condition is always present at birth.",0
Drinking alcohol and using the anti-seizure medicines depakote and dilantin during pregnancy have been associated with increased incidence of VSDs.,0
Atrial septal defect or ASD is a type of congenital heart defect in which the wall separating the upper chambers of the heart does not fuse completely.,0
"During fetal development, the opening between the two atria (the upper chambers of the heart) is needed to allow blood to bypass the lungs .",0
"Eventually, as the fetus becomes more developed, the lungs can support circulation and the opening fuses shut",0
An ASD can result in shunting of blood disproportionately between the right and left sides of the heart.,0
"When a person has no other congenital defect, symptoms may be absent, especially in children",0
Symptoms may begin any time after birth through childhood and even into adulthood.,0
Symptoms may include: Difficulty breathing Heart palpitations in adults Frequent respiratory infections in children Shortness of breath with activity Other health problems may also cause these symptoms .,0
What Causes Atrial Septal Defect.,0
A heart normally develops with a small opening between the two upper chambers of the heart (called atria ) to allow blood to bypass the lungs .,0
"As the lungs become more developed, the heart no longer needs to bypass the blood and the opening between atria will close.",0
"An atrial septal defect occurs when the opening between the two chambers does not close completely In rare cases, the hole may spontaneously close after birth .",0
Shunting refers to when the blood flows from the left chamber to the right chamber.,0
"If too much blood moves from the right side of the heart, pressures in the lungs build up.",0
The shunt can be reversed so that blood flows from right to left.,0
"The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) estimated that, every year,1,966 babies in the United States are born with an atrial septal defect.",0
"As with most congenital heart diseases , it is unclear exactly why certain babies are born with atrial septal defects.",0
"More commonly found in women than men, the female-to-male ratio of 2:1.",0
More common in families with a history of genetic problems and other congenital heart diseases.,0
Certain types of atrial septal defects are associated to down syndrome .,0
Genetic counseling may be performed to estimate the likelihood that any future children may be born with an atrial septal defect.,0
Expectant mothers exposed to rubella may have an increased risk in having a baby with a heart defect.,0
Drug and alcohol use during pregnancy can harm fetal development.,0
Alcohol use during pregnancy nearly doubles the likelihood of an atrial septal defect.,0
"Call your health care provider if your baby has the following symptoms as soon as possible: Heart failure Shortness of breath (Dyspnea) Bluish coloring to the skin Failure to thrive Call your health care provider if you are an adult experiencing the following symptoms: Heart failure Shortness of breath (Dyspnea) Bluish coloring to the skin Pounding or racing of the heart Diagnosis Listening to heart sounds (Auscultation) : Using a stethoscope , a doctor can listen to the beating of the heart .",0
A doctor may hear abnormal heart sounds called a murmur .,0
"If the defect is large enough, the increase in blood flow across the heart valves may create a secondary murmur between beats.",0
"Echocardiography : This kind of non-invasive, painless sonar test can help the doctor closely examine an atrial septal defect.",0
"It uses sound waves to produce an image of the ventricles , atrium and great vessels .",0
An echocardiogram can determine if blood is flowing properly from the right to the left systems.,0
"Furthermore, the doctor can measure the speed of blood flow through patient's heart and the pulmonary blood pressure using the echocardiogram.",0
This is important to determine if there is excess flow through the lungs and if there is damage to the vessels in the lung.,0
Chest x-ray : An x-ray image of chest allows the doctor to check the size and shape of your heart .,0
A chest x ray also helps the doctor check the condition of your lungs.,0
Patients with an atrial septal defect may show enlarged right atrial border on an x ray.,0
"Chest CT or MRI : A chest CT or MRI can demonstrate the details of the heart extremely well, such as the positions of valvular, vascular, atrial and ventricular structures and their relationships to one another.",0
Electrocardiogram (ECG): Electrocardiogram determine if there are abnormal electrical activities of the heart as a result of an ASD.,0
The ECG can provide information about the heart rhythm and the size of the heart chambers.,0
Treatment Options The classification of the atrial septal defect must be assessed.,0
"Potential tests include: MRI Chest x-ray Echocardiogram If the atrial septal defect is determined to be an ostium secundum defect , patients have the option of percutaneous transcatheter closure or surgical closure.",0
"Percutaneous closure is minimally invasive, traveling through the femoral artery up to the heart.",0
It involves the usage of a guide wire catheter to close the septal hole.,0
Surgical closure is more invasive and involves the usage of sutures to close the septal hole.,0
The purpose of both procedures is to close the septal hole and restore normal circulation from the right to left sides of the heart .,0
"If the atrial septal defect is determined to be any other type, the only option is surgical closure .",0
"This invasive procedure varies in execution depending on the gender and age of the patient, as certain incisions are more appropriate for specific genders and specific age groups.",0
"Recovery time is difficult to generalize and depends largely on the type of incision, the age of the patient, and the severity of symptoms",0
"Prophylactic (preventive) antibiotics should be given prior to dental procedures to reduce the risk of developing infective endocarditis immediately after surgery for the ASD, but they are not required later on.",0
Where to Find Medical Care for an Atrial Septal Defect.,0
Directions to hospitals treating atrial septal defects What to Expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
Small atrial septal defects often cause very few problems and may be found much later in life.,0
"Many problems can occur if the shunt is large, however.",0
In advanced and severe cases with large shunts the increased pressure on the right side of the heart would result in reversal of blood flow (now from right to left).,0
This usually results in significant shortness of breath.,0
"With a small to moderate atrial septal defect, a person may live a normal life span without symptoms .",0
Larger defects may cause disability by middle age because of increased blood flow and shunting of blood back into the pulmonary circulation .,0
"Some patients with ASD may have other congenital heart conditions, such as a leaky valve.",0
"Possible Complications Individuals with ASD are at an increased risk for developing a number of complications including: Rapid heart rate (in adults) Heart failure Pulmonary overcirculation Hypertension in the lungs Stroke Heart infections ( endocarditis ) Prevention There is no known way to prevent the defect, but some of the complications can be prevented with early detection.",0
"An ASD Patient's Perspective Disclaimer: It is the aim of WikiDoc to connect patients with real, tangible information as they learn more about the conditions that affect their lives directly.",0

"While a baby grows in the womb, there is a normal opening between the left and right atria (upper chambers) of the heart.",0
"If this opening fails to close naturally soon after the baby is born, the hole is called patent foramen ovale (PFO).",0
Infants with a patent foramen ovale and no other heart defects do not have symptoms .,0
What causes Patent foramen ovale.,0
A foramen ovale allows blood to bypass the lungs .,0
"A baby's lungs are not used when it grows in the womb, so the hole does not cause problems in an unborn infant .",0
"The opening is supposed to close soon after birth , but sometimes it does not.",0
"In about 1 out of 4 people, the opening never closes.",0
"If it does not, it is called a patent foramen ovale (PFO).",0
The cause of a PFO is unknown.,0
There are no known risk factors.,0
Mostly patent foramen ovale stays asymptomatic.,0
In case of development of weakness of any part of body ( stroke ) seek urgent care.,0
Diagnosis An echocardiogram can be done to diagnose a PFO.,0
"If the PFO is not easily seen, a cardiologist can perform a bubble test.",0
Saline solution (salt water) is injected into the body as the cardiologist watches the heart on an ultrasound ( echocardiogram ) monitor.,0
"If a PFO exists, tiny air bubbles will be seen moving from the right to left side of the heart .",0
Treatment options This condition is not treated unless other heart abnormalities exist or if you had a stroke caused by a blood clot to the brain .,0
Treatment usually requires cardiac cathertization by a specifically trained cardiologist to permanently seal the PFO.,0
Where to find medical care for an Patent foramen ovale.,0
Directions to hospitals treating Patent foramen ovales What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
The infant will have normal health in the absence of other heart defects.,0
"Possible complications Unless there are other associated defects, there are usually no complications associated with a PFO.",0
There have been some studies suggesting that older patients with PFOs have a higher rate of a certain type of stroke (called paradoxical thromboembolic stroke).,0
The reason for this is that older people frequently develop blood clots in the veins in their legs.,0
These clots can sometimes travel from their original site to the right side of their heart .,0
"If a PFO is present, the clot can then pass from the right side to the left side and may travel to the brain and become lodged there, preventing blood flow to that part of the brain (stroke)",0
Some patients may take medication to prevent blood clots.,0
"Prevention There is no known way to prevent the defect, but some of the complications can be prevented with early detection.",0
Tetralogy of Fallot refers to a type of congenital heart defect .,0
Congenital means present at birth .,0
Tetralogy of Fallot is classified as a cyanotic heart defect because the condition causes low oxygen levels in the blood .,0
This leads to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin ).,0
"The classic form of tetralogy includes four related defects of the heart and its major blood vessels : Ventricular septal defect (hole between the right and left ventricles ) Narrowing of the pulmonary outflow tract (the valve and artery that connect the heart with the lungs ) Overriding aorta (the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body) that is shifted over the right ventricle and ventricular septal defect , instead of coming out only from the left ventricle A thickened muscular wall of the right ventricle ( right ventricular hypertrophy ) At birth , infants may not show signs of cyanosis ",0
"However, later they may develop sudden episodes (called Tet spells ) of bluish skin from crying or feeding.",0
"Tetralogy of Fallot is rare, but it is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease .",0
Patients with tetralogy of Fallot have a higher incidence of major non-heart congenital defects.,0
"The most common symptoms include: Clubbing of fingers ( skin or bone enlargement around the fingernails ) Cyanosis , which becomes more pronounced when the baby is upset Difficult feeding ( poor feeding habits ) Failure to gain weight Passing out Poor development Squatting during episodes of cyanosis What causes Tetralogy of Fallot.",0
Many factors seem to be involved.,0
"Factors that increase the risk for this condition during pregnancy include: Alcoholism in the mother Diabetes Mother who is over 40 years old Poor nutrition during pregnancy Rubella or other viral illnesses during pregnancy There is a high incidence of chromosomal disorders in children with tetralogy of Fallot, such as Down syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome (a condition that causes heart defects, low calcium levels, and immune deficiency ).",0
Possible Complications.,0
Delayed growth and development Irregular heart rhythms ( arrhythmias ) Seizures during periods when there is not enough oxygen .,0
Death Exams and Tests A physical examination with a stethoscope almost always reveals a heart murmur .,0
Tests may include: Chest x-ray Complete blood count ( CBC ) Echocardiogram Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) MRI of the heart (generally after surgery ) Treatment options Surgery to repair tetralogy of Fallot is done when the infant is very young.,0
Sometimes more than one surgery is needed.,0
"When more than one surgery is used, the first surgery is done to help increase blood flow to the lungs .",0
Surgery to correct the problem may be done at a later time.,0
Often only one corrective surgery is performed in the first few months of life.,0
Corrective surgery is done to widen part of the narrowed pulmonary tract and close the ventricular septal defect .,0
When to Contact a Medical Professional.,0
"Most often, this condition is diagnosed during routine examination of an infant .",0
"Call your infant's health care provider if the baby seems to be having difficulty breathing, or if the baby seems to have an unusual number of respiratory infections .",0
Outlook (Prognosis) Call your health care provider if new unexplained symptoms develop or the patient is having an episode of cyanosis ( blue skin ).,0
"If a child with tetralogy of Fallot becomes blue, immediately place the child on his or her side or back and put the knees up to the chest .",0
Calm the baby and seek medical attention immediately.,0

Babies who have surgery usually do well.,0
"Ninety percent survive to adulthood and live active, healthy, and productive lives",0
"Without surgery, death usually occurs by the time the person reaches age 20.",0
"Patients who have continued, severe leakiness of the pulmonary valve may need to have the valve replaced.",0
Regular follow-up with a cardiologist to monitor for life-threatening arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) is recommended.,0
Possible complications Delayed growth and development Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias) Seizures during periods when there is not enough oxygen Death Sources NLM,0
Tetralogy of Fallot (fuh-LOE) is a rare condition caused by the combination of four heart defects that are present at birth.,0
"These defects, which affect the structure of the heart, cause oxygen-poor blood to flow out of the heart and into the rest of the body",0
Infants and children with tetralogy of Fallot usually have blue-tinged skin because their blood doesn't carry enough oxygen.,0
Tetralogy of Fallot is often diagnosed during infancy or soon after.,0
"However, tetralogy of Fallot may not be detected until later in life, depending on the severity of the defects and symptoms",0
"With early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment, most children with tetralogy of Fallot live relatively normal lives, though they'll need regular medical care and may have restrictions on exercise",0
"Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms vary, depending on the extent of obstruction of blood flow out of the right ventricle and into the lungs .",0
"Signs and symptoms may include: A bluish coloration of the skin caused by blood low in oxygen (cyanosis) Shortness of breath and rapid breathing, especially during feeding Loss of consciousness (fainting) Clubbing of fingers and toes — an abnormal, rounded shape of the nail bed Poor weight gain Tiring easily during play Irritability Prolonged crying A heart murmur Tet spells Sometimes, babies with tetralogy of Fallot will suddenly develop deep blue skin , nails and lips after crying, feeding",0
These episodes are called Tet spells and are caused by a rapid drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood.,0
Toddlers or older children may instinctively squat when they are short of breath.,0
Squatting increases blood flow to the lungs .,0
"Tet spells are more common in young infants, around 2 to 4 months old.",0
What are the causes of Tetralogy of Fallot.,0
"The classic form of tetralogy includes four related defects of the heart and its major blood vessels : Ventricular septal defect (hole between the right and left ventricles) Narrowing of the pulmonary outflow tract (the valve and artery that connect the heart with the lungs) Overriding aorta (the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body) that is shifted over the right ventricle and ventricular septal defect, instead of coming out only from the left ventricle A thickened muscular wall of the right ventricle (right ventricular hypertrophy) At birth, infants may not show signs of cyanosis",0

"While the exact cause of Tetralogy of Fallot is unknown, several factors may increase the risk of a baby being born with this condition.",0
"These include: A viral illness in the mother, such as rubella (German measles), during pregnancy Maternal alcoholism Poor nutrition A mother older than 40 A parent with tetralogy of Fallot Babies who are also born with Down syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome How to know you have Tetralogy of Fallot",0
If you or you're baby have any of the symptoms listed above.,0
Contact your doctor if you are unsure.,0
"When to seek urgent medical care Seek medical help if you notice that your baby has the following symptoms: Difficulty breathing Bluish discoloration of the skin Passing out or seizures Weakness Unusual irritability If your baby becomes blue (cyanotic), immediately place your child on his or her side and pull the knees up to the chest.",0

Cardiogenic shock is when the heart has been damaged so much that it is unable to supply enough blood to the organs of the body.,0
"Chest pain or pressure Coma Decreased urination Fast breathing Fast pulse Heavy sweating , moist skin Lightheadedness Loss of alertness and ability to concentrate Restlessness , agitation , confusion Shortness of breath Skin that feels cool to the touch Pale skin color or blotchy skin Weak (thready) pulse What causes Cardiogenic shock.",0
Cardiogenic shock occurs whenever the heart is unable to pump as much blood as the body needs.,0
The most common causes are serious heart complications.,0
Many of these occur during or after a heart attack (myocardial infarction).,0
"These complications include: A large section of heart muscle that no longer moves well or does not move at all Breaking open (rupture) of the heart muscle due to damage from the heart attack Dangerous heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , or supraventricular tachycardia Pressure on the heart due to a build up of fluid around it ( pericardial tamponade ) Tear or rupture of the muscles or tendons that support the heart valves, especially the mitral valve Tear or rupture of the wall (septum) between the left and right ventricles (lower heart chambers) Very slow heart rhythm ( bradycardia ) or problem with the electrical system of the heart (heart block) Diagnosis An examination will show: Low blood pressure (usually less than 90 systolic) Blood pressure drops more than 10 points when you stand up after lying down (orthostatic hypotension) Weak (thready) pulse To diagnose cardiogenic shock, a catheter (tube) may be placed in the lung artery (right heart catheterization).",0
Tests may show that blood is backing up into the lungs and the heart is not pumping properly.,0
Tests include: Cardiac catheterization Chest x-ray Coronary angiography Echocardiogram Electrocardiogram Nuclear scan of the heart Other studies may be done to find out why the heart is not working properly.,0
"Lab tests include: Arterial blood gas Blood chemistry (chem-7, chem-20, electrolytes) Cardiac enzymes ( troponin , CKMB) Complete blood count ( CBC ) Thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) When to seek urgent medical care.",0
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of cardiogenic shock.,0
Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency.,0
Treatment options Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency.,0
"You will need to stay in the hospital, usually in the Intensive Care Unit.",0
The goal of treatment is to find and treat the cause of shock to save your life.,0
"You may need medicines to increase blood pressure and improve heart function, including: Dobutamine Dopamine Epinephrine Levosimendan Milrinone Norepinephrine These medicines may help in the short-term.",0
They are not usually used for a long time.,0
"When a heart rhythm disturbance (dysrhythmia) is serious, urgent treatment may be needed to restore a normal heart rhythm.",0
"This may include: Electrical shock therapy ( defibrillation or cardioversion ) Implanting a temporary pacemaker Medications given through a vein (intravenous) You may also receive: Pain medicine Oxygen Fluids, blood, and blood products through a vein (IV) Other treatments for shock may include: Cardiac catheterization with coronary angioplasty and stenting Heart monitoring to guide treatment Heart surgery ( coronary artery bypass surgery , heart valve replacement, left ventricular assist device ) Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation ( IABP ) to help the heart work better Pacemaker Ventricular assist device Medications to avoid Patients diagnosed with cardiogenic shock should avoid using the following medications: Acebutolol Amiodarone Atenolol Carteolol Esmolol Flecainide Nebivolol Penbutolol Pindolol Propranolol Sotalol Timolol Verapamil Labetalol If you have been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, consult your physician before starting or stopping any of these medications.",0
"Prevention of Cardiogenic shock You may reduce the risk of developing cardiogenic shock by: Quickly treating its cause (such as heart attack or heart valve problem) Preventing and treating the risk factors for heart disease, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and triglycerides, or tobacco use What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis)",0
"In the past, the death rate from cardiogenic shock ranged from 80 - 90%.",0

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common types of progressive dementia .,0
Lewy body disease usually begins between the ages of 50 and 85 .,0
The disease gets worse over time.,0
"The criteria for DLB is dementia symptoms and 2 or 3 of the below: Parkinsonism : slowness and stiffness Recurrent detailed visual hallucinations , delusions (false beliefs) Symptoms fluctuate markedly from day to day What causes Dementia with Lewy bodies.",0
The symptoms of DLB are caused by the build-up of Lewy bodies which are accumulated bits of alpha-synuclein protein inside the nuclei of neurons in areas of the brain that control particular aspects of memory and motor control.,0
"Researchers don’t know exactly why alpha-synuclein accumulates into Lewy bodies or how Lewy bodies cause the symptoms of DLB, but they do know that alpha-synuclein accumulation is also linked to Parkinson's disease , multiple system atrophy, and several other disorders, which are referred to as the synucleinopathies ",0
"DLB usually occurs sporadically , in people with no known family history of the disease.",0
"However, rare familial cases have occasionally been reported.",0
"Brief episodes of confusion and orientation to time or place Mild memory problems Well defined, vivid hallucinations Tremors or rigidity (especially if Haldol or other anti-psychotics given) Person has rigid, false beliefs that can’t be changed by convincing Unexplained loss of consciousness , frequent falls Symptoms can be temporary - vary from day to day or even throughout the day Diagnosis The central feature of DLB is progressive cognitive decline, combined with three additional defining features: Pronounced fluctuations in alertness and attention, such as frequent drowsiness ",0
People may also suffer from depression .,0
Treatment options There is no cure for DLB .,0
"Treatments are aimed at controlling the cognitive, psychiatric, and motor symptoms of the disorder",0
"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors , such as donepezil and rivastigmine , are primarily used to treat the cognitive symptoms of DLB, but they may also be of some benefit in reducing the psychiatric and motor symptoms.",0
Doctors tend to avoid prescribing antipsychotics for hallucinatory symptoms of DLB because of the risk that neuroleptic sensitivity could worsen the motor symptoms.,0
Some individuals with DLB may benefit from the use of levodopa for their rigidity and loss of spontaneous movement.,0
"Diseases with similar symptoms The similarity of symptoms between DLB and Parkinson’s disease , and between DLB and Alzheimer’s disease , can often make it difficult for a doctor to make a definitive diagnosis",0
"In addition, Lewy bodies are often also found in the brains of people with Parkinson's and Alzheimer’s diseases.",0
These findings suggest that either DLB is related to these other causes of dementia or that an individual can have both diseases at the same time.,0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Dementia with Lewy bodies What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
"Like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease , DLB is a neuro-degenerative disorder that results in progressive intellectual and functional deterioration .",0
There are no known therapies to stop or slow the progression of DLB.,0
"Average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that in Alzheimer’s disease , about 8 years , with progressively increasing disability",0
Hydrocephalus is a condition in which the brain swells due to a build up of fluid inside the skull.,0
Hydrocephalus literally means water on the brain.,0
Hydrocephalus is dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.,0
60% of people who do not seek medical treatment die.,0
"Symptoms of Hydrocephalus can vary from person to person and usually depend on age, severity, and cause",0
Infants: Bulging soft spot ( fontanelle ) Larger than normal head size Seizures Vomiting Constant tiredness Irritability Gaps between skull bones Eyes that are constantly looking down Older children: Headache Irritability Tantrums Constant tiredness Shrill cries Changes in ability to think or act Personality changes Uncontrollable eye movements Changes in eye shape Double vision Changes in appearance of facial features or shape Trouble coordinating motor movements Difficulty walking Slowed growth Trouble eating Muscle spasms Loss of bladder control Nausea What are the causes of Hydrocephalus.,0
There is a layer of fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the brain and spinal cord and creates a cushion between the brain and the skull.,0
"Normally the CSF flows in and around the brain providing nutrients and oxygen before getting reabsorbed by the bloodstream but, when something goes wrong the CSF may begin to build up and put pressure on the brain.",0
Many times the cause of hydrocephalus remains unknown.,0
But some of the known causes include the following: Causes of CSF blockage include: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) Tumors Genetic defects In-utero infections Bleeding in the brain in premature infants Meningitis Other infections contracted after birth Who is at highest risk.,0
Premature babies are often at higher risk.,0
Diagnosis To diagnosis Hydrocephalus the following tests are usually employed: CT scan Physical examination performed by a doctor Head size measurements to see if the head is getting bigger over time X-ray Arteriography Cranial ultrasound Brain scan using radioisotopes Lumbar puncture When to seek urgent medical care.,0
Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY if you suspect hydrocephalus or see any of the signs or symptoms listed above.,0
Hydrocephalus is a severe condition that could result in death if left untreated Treatment options Treatment options include: Surgery to insert a shunt: which sends CSF to another part of the body to reduce the build up in the brain Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV): a procedure done to relieve pressure in the brain Antibiotics: if an infection is the cause of the hydrocephalus Removing areas of the brain that produce CSF If brain damage has occurred because of Hydrocephalus children may receive follow-up services to assist with their disabilities.,0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Hydrocephalus Prevention of Hydrocephalus Prevent trauma to the brain of infants and children: make sure their heads are protected to prevent TBI Immediate treatment of infections that could lead to Hydrocephalus What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
Prognosis is poor if Hydrocephalus is left untreated and usually results in death.,0
Prognosis is also poor for individuals with brain tumors or severe infections.,0
Even individuals that recover from Hydrocephalus may face permanent brain damage that can lead to both physical and mental disabilities.,0
Possible complications Complications can include: Surgery complications Complications with the shunt following surgery in which the shunt becomes blocked and ceases to drain the CSF adequately Mental disabilities Physical disabilities Neurological impairments Infections Sources ,0
Dementia is not a specific disease.,0
"Instead, it is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases .",0
"It affects memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior",0
"Usual causes include Alzheimer's disease , stroke , brain tumors , Lewy body disease , Parkinson's disease , Multiple sclerosis ",0
"Patients with dementia may show symptoms as progressively memory loss , difficulty communicating, difficulty reading or writing, difficulty with performing tasks that take some thought, difficulty with coordination and motor functions, withdrawing from social contact",0
"A mental status examination can be used to assess patients' mental function, including language function, motor activity function, recognition function and executive function.",0
Treatments of dementia include therapeutic schedule for the underlying causes and medications to improve symptoms and slow the progression.,0
There is no preventable measurement for most cases of dementia.,0
"When dementia occurs, it usually develops progressively and often decreases patients' quality of life and lifespan.",0
What are the symptoms.,0
"Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function , including: Language Memory Perception Emotional behavior or personality Cognitive skills (such as calculation, abstract thinking, or judgment) Dementia usually first appears as forgetfulness .",0
Mild cognitive impairment is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and the development of dementia.,0
"The early symptoms of dementia can include: Language problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objects Misplacing items Getting lost on familiar routes Personality changes and loss of social skills Losing interest in things you previously enjoyed, flat mood Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge)",0
"The symptoms may include: Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in your own life history, losing awareness of who you are Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night More difficulty reading or writing Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact Having hallucinations , arguments",0
Most types of dementia are nonreversible (degenerative) .,0
Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back.,0
Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia.,0
Lewy body disease is a leading cause of dementia in elderly adults.,0
People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain.,0
Dementia also can be due to many small strokes .,0
This is called vascular dementia .,0
"The following medical conditions also can lead to dementia: Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Huntington's disease Pick's disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Infections that can affect the brain, such as HIV / AIDS and Lyme disease Some causes of dementia may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: Brain tumors Changes in blood glucose , sodium , and calcium levels Low vitamin B12 levels Normal pressure hydrocephalus Use of certain medications, including cimetadine and some cholesterol-lowering medications Chronic alcohol abuse Dementia usually occurs in older age .",0
It is rare in people under age 60.,0
The risk for dementia increases as a person gets older.,0
"Degenerative: This is the most common cause of dementia, named Alzheimer's disease .",0
Stroke Lewy body disease Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Huntington's disease Pick's disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Brain tumors Brain infection Diagnosis Dementia can often be diagnosed with a history and physical exa m by a skilled doctor or nurse.,0
"A health care provider will take a history, do a physical exam (including a neurological exam), and perform some tests of mental function called a mental status examination ",0
"Motor activity function: Whether the patient is unable to perform motor activities even though physical ability remains intact or not Recognition function: Whether the patient is unable to recognize objects, even though sensory function is intact or not Executive function: Whether the patient is unable to plan, organize, think abstractly or not The health care provider may order tests to help determine whether other problems could be causing dementia or making it worse .",0
These conditions include: Thyroid disease Vitamin deficiency Brain tumor Intoxication from medications Chronic infection Anemia Severe depression The following tests and procedures may be done: B12 level Blood ammonia levels Blood chemistry (chem-20) Blood gas analysis Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis Drug or alcohol levels (toxicology screen) Tests for exposure to metals such as lead or arsenic Electroencephalograph (EEG) Glucose test Head CT or MRI Liver function tests Mental status test Serum calcium Serum electrolytes Thyroid function tests Thyroid stimulating hormone level Urinalysis Diseases with similar symptoms Delirium Pseudodementia When to seek urgent medical care.,0
Call your health care provider if symptoms of dementia gets worse .,0
"If the patient experiences either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible: Stupor Mania Treatment options The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of dementia .",0
Treatment depends on the condition causing the dementia.,0
Some people may need to stay in the hospital for a short time.,0
Stopping or changing medications that make confusion worse may improve brain function.,0
There is growing evidence that some kinds of mental exercises can help dementia.,0
Treating conditions that can lead to confusion often greatly improve mental functioning.,0
"Such conditions include: Anemia Decreased oxygen ( hypoxia ) Depression Heart failure Infections Nutritional disorders Thyroid disorders Medications may be needed to control behavior problems caused by a loss of judgement, increased impulsivity, and confusion",0
"Possible medications include: Antipsychotics ( haloperidol , risperdal , olanzapine ) Mood stabilizers ( fluoxetine , imipramine , citalopram ) Serotonin-affecting drugs ( trazodone , buspirone ) Stimulants ( methylphenidate ) Certain drugs may be used to slow the rate at which symptoms worsen .",0
"The benefit from these drugs is often small, and patients and their families may not always notice much of a change.",0
"Donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), galantamine (Razadyne, formerly called Reminyl) Memantine (Namenda) A person's eyes and ears should be checked regularly .",0
"Hearing aids, glasses, or cataract surgery may be needed",0
Psychotherapy or group therapy usually does not help because it may cause more confusion .,0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Dementia Prevention Most causes of dementia are not preventable .,0
"For vascular dementia , keeping a healthy lifestyle , such as eating a low-fat diet, exercising regularly, quitting smoking, and controlling hypertension and diabetes ",0
People with mild cognitive impairment do not always develop dementia.,0
"However, when dementia does occur, it usually gets worse and often decreases quality of life and lifespan",0
"Possible complications Complications depend on the cause of the dementia, but may include the following: Abuse by an overstressed caregiver Increased infections anywhere in the body Loss of ability to function or care for self Loss of ability to interact Reduced lifespan Side effects of medications used to treat the disorder Sources ",0
Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar ( diabetes ) that starts or is first diagnosed during pregnancy.,0
"Usually there are no symptoms, or the symptoms are mild and not life threatening to the pregnant woman.",0
"Often, the blood sugar (glucose) level returns to normal after delivery.",0
"Symptoms may include: Blurred vision Fatigue Frequent infections, including those of the bladder, vagina, and skin Increased thirst Increased urination Nausea and vomiting Weight loss in spite of increased appetite What causes Gestational diabetes.",0
Pregnancy hormones can block insulin from doing its job.,0
"When this happens, glucose levels may increase in a pregnant woman's blood.",0
You are at greater risk for gestational diabetes if you: Are older than 25 when you are pregnant Have a family history of diabetes Gave birth to a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds or had a birth defect Have sugar ( glucose ) in your urine when you see your doctor for a regular prenatal visit Have high blood pressure Have too much amniotic fluid Have had an unexplained miscarriage or stillbirth Were overweight before your pregnancy When to seek urgent medical care.,0
Call your health care provider if you are pregnant and you have symptoms of diabetes .,0
Diagnosis Gestational diabetes usually starts halfway through the pregnancy.,0
All pregnant women should receive an oral glucose tolerance test between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy to screen for the condition.,0
Women who have risk factors for gestational diabetes may have this test earlier in the pregnancy.,0
"Once you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you can see how well you are doing by testing your glucose level at home.",0
The most common way involves pricking your finger and putting a drop of your blood on a machine that will give you a glucose reading.,0
"Treatment options The goals of treatment are to keep blood sugar (glucose) levels within normal limits during the pregnancy, and to make sure that the growing baby is healthy.",0
WATCHING YOUR BABY: Your health care provider should closely check both you and your baby throughout the pregnancy.,0
Fetal monitoring to check the size and health of the fetus often includes ultrasound and nonstress tests .,0
"A nonstress test is a very simple, painless test for you and your baby.",0
A machine that hears and displays your baby's heartbeat (electronic fetal monitor) is placed on your abdomen.,0
"When the baby moves, the baby's heart rate normally increases 15 - 20 beats above its regular rate.",0
Your health care provider can compare the pattern of your baby's heartbeat to movements and find out whether the baby is doing well.,0
The health care provider will look for increases in the baby's normal heart rate occurring within a certain period of time.,0
DIET AND EXERCISE: The best way to improve your diet is by eating a variety of healthy foods.,0
"You should learn how to read food labels, and check them when making food decisions.",0
Talk to your doctor or dietitian if you are a vegetarian or on some other special diet.,0
"In general, your diet should be moderate in fat and protein and provide controlled levels of carbohydrates through foods that include fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates (such as bread, cereal, pasta",0
"You will also be asked to cut back on foods that contain a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastries.",0
You will be asked to eat three small- to moderate-sized meals and one or more snacks each day.,0
Do not skip meals and snacks.,0
"Keep the amount and types of food (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) the same from day to day",0
Your doctor or nurse will prescribe a daily prenatal vitamin.,0
They may suggest that you take extra iron or calcium.,0
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you're a vegetarian or are on some other special diet.,0
Remember that eating for two does not mean you need to eat twice as many calories.,0
"You usually need just 300 extra calories a day (such as a glass of milk, a banana, and 10 crackers)",0
"If managing your diet does not control blood sugar (glucose) levels, you may be prescribed diabetes medicine by mouth or insulin therapy.",0
You will need to monitor your blood sugar (glucose) levels during treatment.,0
"Most women who develop gestational diabetes will not need diabetes medicines or insulin, but some will.",0
Directions to Hospitals Treating Gestational diabetes What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
Most women with gestational diabetes are able to control their blood sugar and avoid harm to themselves or their baby.,0
Pregnant women with gestational diabetes tend to have larger babies at birth.,0
"This can increase the chance of problems at the time of delivery, including: Birth injury (trauma) because of the baby's large size Delivery by c-section Your baby is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the first few days of life.",0
Mothers with gestational diabetes have an increased risk for high blood pressure during pregnancy .,0
There is a slightly increased risk of the baby dying when the mother has untreated gestational diabetes.,0
Controlling blood sugar levels reduces this risk.,0
High blood sugar (glucose) levels often go back to normal after delivery.,0
"However, women with gestational diabetes should be watched closely after giving birth and at regular doctor's appointments to screen for signs of diabetes.",0
Many women with gestational diabetes develop diabetes within 5 - 10 years after delivery.,0
The risk may be increased in obese women .,0
Possible complications Delivery-related complications due to the infant's large size Development of diabetes later in life Increased risk of newborn death and stillbirth Low blood sugar (glucose) or illness in the newborn Prevention Beginning prenatal care early and having regular prenatal visits helps improve your health and the health of your baby.,0
Knowing the risk factors for gestational diabetes and having prenatal screening at 24 - 28 weeks into the pregnancy will help detect gestational diabetes early.,0
"If you are overweight , decreasing your body mass index (BMI) to a normal range before you get pregnant will decrease your risk of developing gestational diabetes.",0

Possible complications Prevention Diabetes mellitus type 1 On the Web Ongoing Trials at Clinical Trials.gov Images of Diabetes mellitus type 1 Videos on Diabetes mellitus type 1 FDA on Diabetes mellitus type 1 CDC on Diabetes mellitus type 1 Diabetes mellitus type 1 in the news Blogs on Diabetes mellitus type 1 Directions to Hospitals Treating Diabetes mellitus type 1 Risk calculators and risk factors for Diabetes mellitus type 1 Editor-In-Chief: C.,0
"Michael Gibson, M.S M.D",0
"Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and was previously known as juvenile diabetes.",0
"In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin .",0
"More specifically, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the body’s immune system has attacked and destroyed them.",0
"Insulin is a hormone that is needed to convert sugar ( glucose ), starches and other food into energy needed for daily life.",0
"The causes of type 1 diabetes appear to be much different than those for type 2 diabetes, though the exact mechanisms for developing both diseases are unknown.",0
"The appearance of type 1 diabetes is suspected to follow exposure to an environmental trigger, such as an unidentified virus, stimulating an immune attack against the beta cells of the pancreas (that produce insulin) in some genetically predisposed people",0
People who think they might have diabetes must visit a physician for diagnosis.,0
They might have some or none of the following symptoms: Frequent urination Excessive thirst Unexplained weight loss Extreme hunger Sudden vision changes Tingling or numbness in hands or feet Fatigue Very dry skin Sores that are slow to heal More infections than usual.,0
"Nausea , vomiting , or stomach pains may accompany some of these symptoms in the abrupt onset of insulin-dependent diabetes, now called type 1 diabetes.",0
Diseases with similar symptoms Diabetes mellitus type 2 Diabetes insipidus Gestational diabetes What causes Diabetes mellitus type 1.,0
There are several forms of diabetes.,0
Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile or insulin-dependent diabetes.,0
"Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults.",0
"Insulin is a hormone produced by special cells, called beta cells, in the pancreas, an organ located in the area behind your stomach.",0
"Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells, where it is stored and later used for energy.",0
"In type 1 diabetes, these cells produce little or no insulin.",0
"Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells.",0
The body is unable to use this glucose for energy.,0
This leads to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes.,0
"Within 5 - 10 years, the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are completely destroyed and the body can no longer produce insulin.",0
"The exact cause is unknown, but most likely there is a viral or environmental trigger in genetically susceptible people that causes an immune reaction.",0
The body's white blood cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells.,0
"Risk factors are less well defined for type 1 diabetes than for type 2 diabetes, but autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors are involved in developing this type of diabetes.",0
Why is it important to take care of your diabetes.,0
"After many years, diabetes can lead to serious problems with your eyes , kidneys , nerves , and gums and teeth ",0
But the most serious problem caused by diabetes is heart disease .,0
"When you have diabetes, you are more than twice as likely as people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke .",0
"If you have diabetes, your risk of a heart attack is the same as someone who has already had a heart attack.",0
Both women and men with diabetes are at risk.,0
You may not even have the typical signs of a heart attack .,0
You can reduce your risk of developing heart disease by controlling your blood pressure and blood fat levels.,0
"If you smoke, talk with your doctor about quitting.",0
"Anyone aged 45 years or older should consider getting tested for diabetes, especially if you are overweight .",0
"If you are younger than 45, but are overweight and have one or more additional risk factors, you should consider testing",0
"In addition, if blood glucose levels get too high or low, urgent medical care may be needed to prevent losing consciousness or a diabetic coma ",0
Diagnosis There are two different tests your doctor can use to determine whether you have pre-diabetes or diabetes: the fasting plasma glucose test ( FPG ) or the oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ).,0
"The blood glucose levels measured after these tests determine whether you have a normal metabolism, or whether you have pre-diabetes or diabetes.",0
"If your blood glucose level is abnormal following the FPG, you have impaired fasting glucose (IFG); if your blood glucose level is abnormal following the OGTT, you have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)",0
FPG OGTT Treatment options The main goal of treatment is to get your blood glucose ( sugar ) levels under control in order to increase your chances of a complication-free life.,0
People with diabetes should see a health care provider who will monitor their diabetes control and help them learn to manage their diabetes.,0
"In addition, many people with type 1 diabetes require oral medication, insulin, or both to control their blood glucose levels.",0
"Healthy Living Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes",0
"People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care, and keep blood glucose levels from going too low or too high.",0
Blood glucose monitoring is the main tool you have to check your diabetes control.,0
This check tells you your blood glucose level at any one time.,0
Keeping a log of your results is vital.,0
"When you bring this record to your health care provider, you have a good picture of your body's response to your diabetes care plan.",0
Blood glucose checks let you see what works and what doesn't.,0
"This allows you and your doctor, dietitian, or nurse educator to make needed changes",0
How do blood checks work.,0
"You stick your finger with a special needle, called a lancet, to get a drop of blood",0
"With some meters, you can also use your forearm, thigh or fleshy part of your hand",0
There are spring-loaded lancing devices that make sticking yourself less painful.,0
"Before using the lancing device, wash your hands or site you chose with soap and water.",0
"If you use your fingertip, stick the side of your fingertip by your fingernail to avoid having sore spots on the frequently used part of your finger.",0
Blood glucose meters are small computerized machines that read your blood glucose.,0
"In all types of meters, your blood glucose level shows up as a number on a screen (like that on your pocket calculator).",0
Be sure your doctor or nurse educator shows you the correct way to use your meter.,0
"With all the advances in blood glucose meters, use of a meter is better than visual checking.",0
"In addition, you may need to check your urine for ketones once in a while.",0
Ketones in the urine is a sign that your body is using fat for energy instead of using glucose because not enough insulin is available to use glucose for energy.,0
Ketones in the urine is more common in type 1 diabetes.,0
"Insulin Inside the pancreas , beta cells make the hormone insulin.",0
"With each meal, beta cells release insulin to help the body use or store the blood glucose it gets from food.",0
People with type 1 diabetes do not make enough insulin.,0
Some people with type 1 diabetes need diabetes pills or insulin shots to help their bodies use glucose for energy.,0
Insulin cannot be taken as a pill.,0
The insulin would be broken down during digestion just like the protein in food.,0
Insulin must be injected into the fat under your skin for it to get into your blood.,0
There are many different insulins for many different situations and lifestyles and there are more than 20 types of insulin sold in the United States.,0
"These insulins differ in how they are made, how they work in the body, and price",0
"Other In addition, people with diabetes may see endocrinologists, who may specialize in diabetes care; ophthalmologists for eye examinations; podiatrists for routine foot care; and dietitians and diabetes educators who teach the skills needed for daily diabetes management",0
Adults with diabetes are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).,0
"In fact, at least 65 percent of those with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke .",0
"Managing diabetes is more than keeping blood glucose levels under control—it is also important to manage blood pressure and cholesterol levels through healthy eating, physical activity, and the use of medications, if needed.",0
"By doing so, those with diabetes can lower their risk.",0
"Aspirin therapy, if recommended by a person’s health care team, and smoking cessation can also help lower risk",0
"Medications to avoid Patients diagnosed with type I diabetes mellitus should avoid using the following medications: Glipizide Glyburide Repaglinide If you have been diagnosed with type I diabetes mellitus, consult your physician before starting or stopping any of these medications.",0
Directions to hospitals treating Diabetes mellitus type 1 What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis).,0
"Hypoglycemia, Hyperglycemia, and a High Risk for Diabetic Comas Hypoglycemia, low blood glucose (sugar), sometimes called an insulin reaction, can happen even during those times when you're doing all you can to manage your diabetes.",0
"So, although many times you can't prevent it from happening, hypoglycemia can be treated before it gets worse",0
"The symptoms of hypoglycemia include: Shakiness Dizziness Sweating Hunger Headache Pale skin color Sudden moodiness or behavior changes, such as crying for no apparent reason Clumsy or jerky movements Seizure Difficulty paying attention, or confusion Tingling sensations around the mouth The quickest way to raise your blood glucose and treat hypoglycemia is with some form of sugar, such as 3 glucose tablets (you can buy these at the drug store), 1/2 cup of fruit juice, or 5-6 pieces of hard candy.",0
Ask your health care professional or dietitian to list foods that you can use to treat low blood glucose.,0
Good diabetes control is the best way we know to prevent hypoglycemia .,0
Hyperglycemia is the technical term for high blood glucose (sugar).,0
"High blood glucose happens when the body has too little, or not enough, insulin or when the body can't use insulin properly",0
"If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make enough insulin.",0
It could be that you ate more than planned or exercised less than planned.,0
"The stress of an illness, such as a cold or flu , could also be the cause",0
"Other stresses, such as family conflicts or school or dating problems, could also cause hyperglycemia ",0
"The signs and symptoms include: high blood glucose, high levels of sugar in the urine, frequent urination , and increased thirst .",0
It's important to treat hyperglycemia as soon as you detect it.,0
"If you fail to treat hyperglycemia , a condition called ketoacidosis ( diabetic coma ) could occur.",0
Ketoacidosis develops when your body doesn't have enough insulin.,0
"Often, you can lower your blood glucose level by exercising.",0
Cutting down on the amount of food you eat might also help.,0
Your best bet to prevent hyperglycemia is to practice good diabetes management.,0
Ketoacidosis is life-threatening and needs immediate treatment.,0
It can occur when a case of hyperglycemia gets out of control.,0
Symptoms include: Shortness of breath Breath that smells fruity Nausea and vomiting Very dry mouth Heart Disease and Stroke People with diabetes have extra reason to be mindful of heart and blood vessel disease.,0
"Diabetes carries an increased risk for heart attack , stroke , and complications related to poor circulation",0
2 out of 3 people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke .,0
Diabetes management is more than control of blood glucose.,0
People with diabetes must also manage blood pressure and cholesterol and talk to their health provider to learn about other ways to reduce their chance for heart attacks and stroke.,0
"Again, lifestyle changes, such as choosing foods wisely and being physically active, as well as taking medication can help.",0
"Many people find that changing what they eat can make a big difference in their blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels",0
"Kidney Disease Diabetes can damage the kidneys , which not only can cause them to fail, but can also make them lose their ability to filter out waste products",0
Diabetes can damage the filtering ability of kidneys.,0
High levels of blood sugar make the kidneys filter too much blood.,0
All this extra work is hard on the filters.,0
"After many years, they start to leak.",0
Useful protein is lost in the urine.,0
Having small amounts of protein in the urine is called microalbuminuria .,0
"When kidney disease is diagnosed early, (during microalbuminuria ), several treatments may keep kidney disease from getting worse",0
A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen.,1
Brain changes associated with Alzheimers disease lead to growing trouble with: Everyone has occasional memory lapses.,1
Its normal to lose track of where you put your keys or forget the name of an acquaintance.,1
"But the memory loss associated with Alzheimers disease persists and worsens, affecting the ability to function at work or at home.",1
"People with Alzheimers may: Repeat statements and questions over and over Forget conversations, appointments or events, and not remember them later Routinely misplace possessions, often putting them in illogical locations Get lost in familiar places Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects Have trouble finding the right words to identify objects, express thoughts or take part in conversations Alzheimers disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers.",1
"Multitasking is especially difficult, and it may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time.",1
These difficulties may progress to an inability to recognize and deal with numbers.,1
The ability to make reasonable decisions and judgments in everyday situations will decline.,1
"For example, a person may make poor or uncharacteristic choices in social interactions or wear clothes that are inappropriate for the weather.",1
"It may be more difficult to respond effectively to everyday problems, such as food burning on the stove or unexpected driving situations.",1
"Once-routine activities that require sequential steps, such as planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game, become a struggle as the disease progresses.",1
"Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimers may forget how to perform basic tasks such as dressing and bathing.",1
Brain changes that occur in Alzheimers disease can affect moods and behaviors.,1
"Problems may include the following: Depression Apathy Social withdrawal Mood swings Distrust in others Irritability and aggressiveness Changes in sleeping habits Wandering Loss of inhibitions Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen Many important skills are preserved for longer periods even while symptoms worsen.",1
"Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories and reminiscing, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts.",1
These skills may be preserved longer because they are controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease.,1
"A number of conditions, including treatable conditions, can result in memory loss or other dementia symptoms.",1
"If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your doctor for a thorough assessment and diagnosis.",1
"If you are concerned about thinking skills you observe in a family member or friend, talk about your concerns and ask about going together to a doctors appointment.",1
"Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimers disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time.",1
"Less than 1 percent of the time, Alzheimers is caused by specific genetic changes that virtually guarantee a person will develop the disease.",1
These rare occurrences usually result in disease onset in middle age.,1
"The exact causes of Alzheimers disease arent fully understood, but at its core are problems with brain proteins that fail to function normally, disrupt the work of brain cells neurons and unleash a series of toxic events.",1
"Neurons are damaged, lose connections to each other and eventually die.",1
"The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory, but the process begins years before the first symptoms.",1
The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brains.,1
"By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk significantly.",1
Researchers are focused on the role of two proteins: Plaques.,1
 Beta-amyloid is a leftover fragment of a larger protein.,1
" Although vitamin E isnt effective for preventing Alzheimers, taking 2,000 international units daily may help delay the progression in people who already have the disease.",1
"However, study results have been mixed, with only some showing this benefit.",1
"Further research into the safety of 2,000 international units daily of Vitamin E in a dementia population will be needed before it can be routinely recommended.",1
Supplements promoted for cognitive health can interact with medications youre taking for Alzheimers disease or other health conditions.,1
"Work closely with your health care team to create a safe treatment plan with any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications or dietary supplements.",1
Healthy lifestyle choices promote good overall health and may play a role in maintaining cognitive health.,1
Regular exercise is an important part of a treatment plan.,1
"Activities such as a daily walk can help improve mood and maintain the health of joints, muscles and the heart.",1
Exercise can also promote restful sleep and prevent constipation.,1
People with Alzheimers who develop trouble walking may still be able to use a stationary bike or participate in chair exercises.,1
You may find exercise programs geared to older adults on TV or on DVDs.,1
"People with Alzheimers may forget to eat, lose interest in preparing meals or not eat a healthy combination of foods.",1
"They may also forget to drink enough, leading to dehydration and constipation.",1
Offer the following: Healthy options.,1
 Buy healthy food options that the person with Alzheimers disease likes and can eat.,1
Water and other healthy beverages.,1
 Try to ensure that a person with Alzheimers drinks several glasses of liquids every day.,1
"Avoid beverages with caffeine, which can increase restlessness, interfere with sleep and trigger a frequent need to urinate.",1
"High-calorie, healthy shakes and smoothies.",1
 You can supplement milkshakes with protein powders or make smoothies featuring favorite ingredients.,1
This may be particularly important when eating becomes more difficult.,1
Social interactions and activities can support the abilities and skills that are preserved.,1
Doing things that are meaningful and enjoyable are important for the overall well-being of a person with Alzheimers disease.,1
"These might include: Listening to music or dancing Reading or listening to books Gardening or crafts Social events at senior or memory care centers Planned activities with children People with Alzheimers disease experience a mixture of emotions ‚ confusion, frustration, anger, fear, uncertainty, grief and depression.",1
"If youre caring for someone with Alzheimers, you can help them cope with the disease by being there to listen, reassuring the person that life can still be enjoyed, providing support, and doing your best to help the person retain dignity and self-respect.",1
A calm and stable home environment can help reduce behavior problems.,1
"New situations, noise, large groups of people, being rushed or pressed to remember, or being asked to do complicated tasks can cause anxiety.",1
"As a person with Alzheimers becomes upset, the ability to think clearly declines even more.",1
Caring for a person with Alzheimers disease is physically and emotionally demanding.,1
"Feelings of anger and guilt, stress and discouragement, worry and grief, and social isolation are common.",1
Caregiving can even take a toll on the caregivers physical health.,1
Paying attention to your own needs and well-being is one of the most important things you can do for yourself and for the person with Alzheimers.,1
"If youre a caregiver for someone with Alzheimers, you can help yourself by: Learning as much about the disease as you can Asking questions of doctors, social workers and others involved in the care of your loved one Calling on friends or other family members for help when you need it Taking a break every day Spending time with your friends Taking care of your health by seeing your own doctors on schedule, eating healthy meals and getting exercise Joining a support group Making use of a local adult day center, if possible Many people with Alzheimers and their families benefit from counseling or local support services.",1
"Contact your local Alzheimers Association affiliate to connect with support groups, doctors, occupational therapists, resources and referrals, home care agencies, residential care facilities, a telephone help line, and educational seminars.",1
Medical care for the loss of memory or other thinking skills usually requires a team or partner strategy.,1
"If you are concerned about your memory loss or related symptoms, ask a close relative or friend to go with you to a doctors appointment.",1
"In addition to providing support, your partner can provide help in answering questions.",1
"If you are accompanying someone on a doctors appointment, your role may be to provide some history or your perspective on changes you have observed.",1
This teamwork is an important part of medical care for initial appointments and throughout a treatment plan.,1
"Your primary care doctor may refer you to a neurologist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist or other specialist for further evaluation.",1
You can prepare for your appointment by writing down as much information as possible to share.,1
"Information may include: Medical history, including any past or current diagnoses and family medical history Medical team, including the name and contact information of any current physician, mental health professional or therapist Medications, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbal medications or other dietary supplements Symptoms, including specific examples of changes in memory or thinking skills Your doctor will likely ask a number of the following questions to understand changes in memory or other thinking skills.",1
"If you are accompanying someone to an appointment, be prepared to provide your perspective as needed.",1
Your doctor may ask: What kinds of memory difficulties and mental lapses are you having.,1
When did you first notice them.,1
"Are they steadily getting worse, or are they sometimes better and sometimes worse.",1
"Have you stopped doing certain activities, such as managing finances or shopping, because these activities were too mentally challenging.",1
How is your mood.,1
"Do you feel depressed, sadder or more anxious than usual.",1
Have you gotten lost lately on a driving route or in a situation thats usually familiar to you.,1
Reye syndrome facts Reye syndrome is a rare and severe illness that affects children.,1
Reye syndrome is associated with viral infection and aspirin use.,1
Reye syndrome causes vomiting and mental-status changes .,1
Diagnosing Reye syndrome primarily depends on the clinical history of symptoms.,1
"The most common abnormal laboratory tests with Reye syndrome include elevated liver enzymes , elevated ammonia levels, and low serum glucose levels.",1
"Treatment is supportive, and even with treatment, severe Reye syndrome results in permanent brain damage and death.",1
"Since educating parents about the dangers of aspirin use, the incidence of Reye syndrome has decreased markedly.",1
What is Reye syndrome.,1
3 Reye syndrome is a rare but often severe and even fatal illness that primarily occurs in children and adolescents.,1
Children diagnosed with Reye syndrome generally present with vomiting and mental-status changes.,1
The illness can resolve spontaneously or progress to coma and death.,1
"Although the cause is still unclear, studies have identified that there is a relationship between some viral infections and the use of aspirin medications.",1
"The CDC recommended educating parents about the dangers of treating children with aspirin in the 1980s, and now the disease occurs very rarely.",1
"In 1963, Dr.",1
Ralph Douglas Reye initially described the syndrome.,1
What causes Reye syndrome.,1
"Although there has been extensive research into the cause of Reye syndrome, medical professionals still do not completely understand it.",1
"As mentioned above, the use of aspirin or aspirin-containing medications to treat children with some viral infections, including chickenpox , influenza , and gastroenteritis , is associated with the development of the disease.",1
"Ultimately, the causes of symptoms associated with Reye syndrome relate to dysfunction of the liver and a resultant increase in serum ammonia levels and other toxins.",1
"These toxins cause increased pressure in the brain and swelling, leading to brain dysfunction and can progress to death.",1
What are risk factors for Reye syndrome.,1
Most children diagnosed with Reye syndrome have a history of a recent viral infection.,1
"Health care providers identify chickenpox and influenza most often, though they have also described rotavirus a cause of bowel inflammation or gastroenteritis.",1
"In addition to the recent viral infection, most have a history of taking aspirin to control fever .",1
"Some researchers have suggested that children with undiagnosed metabolic disorders may also be at risk, though this is not completely clear.",1
What are Reye syndrome symptoms and signs.,1
The primary symptoms of Reye syndrome include uncontrolled vomiting and mental-status changes.,1
These symptoms are generally the result of increased intracranial pressure and brain swelling.,1
"If untreated and progressive, the disease is fatal.",1
"Even if physicians identify and treat it early, some patients will still have progressive disease resulting in death or permanent brain damage.",1
How do health care professionals diagnose Reye syndrome.,1
"Doctors consider a diagnosis of Reye syndrome in any child who has unexplained brain dysfunction encephalopathy , vomiting, and liver dysfunction.",1
A history of a recent viral infection and aspirin use certainly supports the diagnosis.,1
"In general, laboratory studies that reveal a prominent blood acidosis and an increase in liver enzymes and ammonia levels and marked decreases in serum glucose hypoglycemia are supportive of the diagnosis.",1
"However, it should be noted that other metabolic disorders can have with similar symptoms.",1
There are reports of undiagnosed metabolic diseases that may be associated with a patient having Reye syndrome-type physical findings and metabolic derangements.,1
Medical professionals describe these patients as having Reye-like syndrome.,1
What is the treatment for Reye syndrome.,1
"1 Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for Reye syndrome.",1
"Primarily, the treatment aims to decrease the effects of the metabolic dysfunction.",1
Health care providers admit patients with Reye syndrome to an intensive care unit where doctors who specialize in the care of critically ill children can manage them.,1
"In this setting, they can be monitored for a worsening neurologic and metabolic condition.",1
The primary goal is to manage electrolyte imbalances and brain swelling.,1
"It is difficult to predict which patients will have a progressive illness, however some recommend using medications aimed at lowering the serum ammonia level ammonia is one cause of increased brain swelling.",1
"In addition, in some cases of progressive and resistant Reye syndrome, physicians have used hemodialysis to remove toxins believed to be partly responsible for the brain swelling.",1
What is the prognosis for Reye syndrome.,1
There is significant variation in outlook amongst children diagnosed with Reye syndrome.,1
It is dependent upon the severity and progression of the disease.,1
"Some children may have mild disease and completely recover, and others may develop permanent dysfunction of the brain or die from the disease.",1
"In general, children diagnosed and treated early in the course of the illness have better outcomes.",1
Studies also suggest that those presenting with high ammonia levels have a worse prognosis.,1
Is it possible to prevent Reye syndrome.,1
"Although we do not know how to prevent Reye syndrome, we do know that reducing aspirin use in children has resulted in a decrease in the incidence of the illness.",1
"In 1980, there were over 500 cases of Reye syndrome in the United States, and now there are only one to two cases per year.",1
"The United Kingdom has seen similar statistics, as well.",1
Health officials attribute this remarkable reduction to the cessation of aspirin use in patients less than 18 years of age.,1
It is important to note that several over-the-counter products contain aspirin or aspirin-like compounds.,1
Pepto-Bismol is such an example.,1
There is a separate product without aspirin-like compounds available.,1
What is the latest research on Reye syndrome.,1
Most research focuses on understanding what the triggers are for Reye syndrome and how aspirin is involved in the disease.,1
"In addition, some are trying to determine why some patients progress rapidly and some cases simply resolve.",1
Where can I find more information about Reye syndrome.,1
Frontotemporal dementia Picks disease facts* * Frontotemporal dementia Picks disease facts medical author: William C.,1
"Shiel Jr., MD, FACP, FACR Frontotemporal dementia FTD, or Picks disease, is a syndrome featuring shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain.",1
"The symptoms of frontotemporal dementia fall into two clinical patterns that involve either: 1 changes in behavior, or 2 problems with language.",1
Frontotemporal dementia is often inherited and runs in families.,1
There is no treatment for frontotemporal dementia and treatment is directed toward minimizing symptoms.,1
Frontotemporal dementia progresses steadily and often rapidly and is fatal.,1
The duration of disease ranges from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others What is frontotemporal dementia Picks disease.,1
Frontotemporal dementia FTD describes a clinical syndrome associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain.,1
"Originally known as Picks disease, the name and classification of frontotemporal dementia has been a topic of discussion for over a century.",1
"The current designation of the syndrome groups together Picks disease, primary progressive aphasia , and semantic dementia as frontotemporal dementia.",1
Some doctors propose adding corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy to frontotemporal dementia and calling the group Pick Complex.,1
These designations will continue to be debated.,1
What are the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia.,1
"5 As it is defined today, the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia fall into two clinical patterns that involve either 1 changes in behavior, or 2 problems with language.",1
"The first type features behavior that can be either impulsive disinhibited or bored and listless apathetic and includes inappropriate social behavior; lack of social tact; lack of empathy; distractability; loss of insight into the behaviors of oneself and others; an increased interest in sex; changes in food preferences; agitation or, conversely, blunted emotions; neglect of personal hygiene; repetitive or compulsive behavior, and decreased energy and motivation.",1
"The second type primarily features symptoms of language disturbance, including difficulty making or understanding speech, often in conjunction with the behavioral types symptoms.",1
Spatial skills and memory remain intact.,1
Is frontotemporal dementia inherited.,1
There is a strong genetic component to the disease; frontotemporal dementia often runs in families.,1
Is there any treatment for frontotemporal dementia.,1
4 No treatment has been shown to slow the progression of frontotemporal dementia.,1
Behavior modification may help control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors.,1
"Aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors could require medication.",1
Antidepressants have been shown to improve some symptoms.,1
What is the prognosis the outlook for frontotemporal dementia.,1
1 The outcome for people with frontotemporal dementia is poor.,1
"The disease progresses steadily and often rapidly, ranging from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others.",1
Eventually some individuals with frontotemporal dementia will need 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in an institutionalized care setting.,1
What research is being done on frontotemporal dementia.,1
"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS, and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health NIH, conduct research related to frontotemporal dementia in laboratories at the NIH, and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.",1
 Reye syndrome is characterized by acute noninflammatory encephalopathy and fatty degenerative liver failure.,1
The syndrome was first described in 1963 in Australia by RDK Reye and described a few months later in the United States by GM Johnson.,1
Cases with identical manifestations were described as early as 1929.,1
"In the United States, Reye syndrome became a reportable disease in 1973.",1
Peak incidence was reported in 1979-80.,1
"Reye syndrome typically occurs after a viral illness, particularly an upper respiratory tract infection, , , or , and is associated with the use of aspirin during the illness.",1
"A dramatic decrease in the use of aspirin among children, in combination with the identification of medication reactions, toxins, and IEMs that present with Reye syndrome‚like manifestations, have made the diagnosis of Reye syndrome exceedingly rare.",1
"With the recognition that Reye syndrome is rare, this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis in any child with vomiting and altered mental status and classic laboratory findings.",1
A high index of suspicion is essential.,1
"Given that manifestations of Reye syndrome are not unique to Reye syndrome but also are seen in a growing list of conditions, and given that no test is specific for Reye syndrome, the diagnosis must be one of exclusion.",1
All children with manifestations suggestive of Reye syndrome should be tested for IEM.,1
"Early recognition and treatment of Reye and Reye-like syndromes, including presumptive treatment for possible IEM See is essential to prevent death and optimize the likelihood of recovery without neurologic impairment.",1
"Some have suggested the term Reye syndrome or Reye-like syndrome should be used to describe clinical manifestations of diseases states regardless of etiology, while causes still without a known etiology after diagnostic workup should be referred to as Reye disease.",1
"The pathogenesis of Reye syndrome, while not precisely elucidated, appears to involve mitochondrial injury resulting in dysfunction that disrupts oxidative phosphorylation and fatty-acid beta-oxidation in a virus-infected, sensitized host potentially with an underlying occult inborn error of fatty acid oxidation, urea cycle or mitochondrial disorder.",1
"The host has usually been exposed to mitochondrial toxins, most commonly salicylates >80% of cases.",1
"Histologic changes include cytoplasmic fatty vacuolization in hepatocytes, astrocyte edema and loss of neurons in the brain, and edema and fatty degeneration of the proximal lobules in the kidneys.",1
"All cells have pleomorphic, swollen mitochondria that are reduced in number, along with glycogen depletion and minimal tissue inflammation.",1
"Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction results in hyperammonemia, which is thought to induce astrocyte edema, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure ICP.",1
Influenza virus types A and B and varicella-zoster virus are the pathogens most commonly associated with Reye syndrome.,1
"Other pathogens include parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, measles, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, retrovirus, hepatitis virus types A and B, mycoplasma, chlamydia, pertussis, shigella, salmonella, and polio.",1
Reye has occurred after immunization with live viral vaccines.,1
"The association of Reye syndrome with salicylates, particularly aspirin, was demonstrated in several epidemiologic studies around the world.",1
"Less than 0.1% of children who took aspirin developed Reye syndrome, but more than 80% of patients diagnosed with Reye syndrome had taken aspirin in the past 3 weeks.",1
"A causal relation between Reye syndrome and salicylates has not been definitively established and has been questioned on the basis of biases and limitations in the studies, but recommendations by government health agencies that children not be treated with salicylates led to an immediate and dramatic decrease in the incidence of Reye syndrome.",1
Results of in vitro studies are contradictory on impact of aspirin on beta-oxidation metabolism.,1
One study demonstrated that salicylates decrease beta-oxidation of the long-chain fatty acid palmitate by cultured fibroblasts from children who recovered from Reye syndrome as compared with control subjects.,1
"Another study showed that in two different cell lines, aspirin increased mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation, did not change oxidation of medium chain fatty acids, and inhibited peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, which suggest that aspirin impairs long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria.",1
"Some have postulated that salicylates stimulate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS because of the findings of iNOS stimulation in African children with fatal malaria, a disease that causes symptoms similar to those of Reye syndrome and is often treated with aspirin.",1
Recognition of the structural similarity between aspirin metabolites and enzyme substrates for the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme important in beta-oxidation led to identification of the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase LCHAD component of the enzyme as the target of salicylate inhibition.,1
Absence of inhibition of beta-oxidation by salicylates in fibroblasts from patients with LCHAD deficiency substantiated the finding.,1
"Acetaminophen, outdated tetracycline, valproic acid, warfarin, zidovudine didanosine, and some neoplastic drugs have been associated with Reye syndrome or Reye-like syndrome.",1
"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including sodium diclofenac and mefenamic acid, are thought to produce or worsen Reye syndrome.",1
"An association with antiemetics, such as phenothiazines, has been postulated but not substantiated.",1
"An association with acetaminophen was reported but has been refuted, although there may be a synergistic effect of acetaminophen and salicylates.",1
"Reye syndrome or Reye-like syndrome may also be associated with insecticides; herbicides; aflatoxins; isopropyl alcohol; paint; paint thinner; margosa neem oil; hepatotoxic mushrooms; Jamaican vomiting sickness; and herbal medications with atractyloside, a diterpenoid glycoside found in the extracts of the tuber of impila poisoning.",1
cereulide toxin has also been reported as producing Reye syndrome.,1
"IEMs that produce Reye-like syndromes include fatty-acid oxidation defects, particularly medium-chain acyl dehydrogenase MCAD and long-chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiency LCAD inherited and acquired forms, urea-cycle defects, amino and organic acidopathies, primary carnitine deficiency, and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism.",1
"Undoubtedly, other IEMs that cause Reye-like syndrome will be identified.",1
The percentage of patients with a previous diagnosis of Reye syndrome is 0.4%.,1
The percentage of patients who have a sibling with a Reye syndrome history is 2.9%.,1
It is likely that at least of some of these patients had an IEM rather than Reye syndrome.,1
"IEMs may account for the heterogeneity of disease manifestations in patients younger than 5 years who have received a diagnosis of Reye syndrome, especially those younger than 1 year.",1
The possibility that IEMs are more likely than true Reye syndrome in patients younger than 5 years may also explain why decreases in salicylate use and decreases in the incidence of Reye syndrome have been greatest in patients older than 5 years.,1
"IEM is suggested by recurrence of symptoms, precipitating factors, including prolonged fasting, changes in diet, decompensation out of proportion to intercurrent illnesses, failure to thrive, neurologic abnormalities, neurologic dysfunction, and family members with similar symptoms and/or unexplained infant deaths.",1
"In the United States, national surveillance for Reye syndrome began in 1973.",1
"It is believed that before the 1970s, most of the cases that met the criteria for Reye syndrome were diagnosed as encephalitis or drug intoxication.",1
The peak annual incidence of 555 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC was in 1979-1980.,1
"Between December 1, 1980, and November 30, 1997, 1207 cases of Reye syndrome in patients younger than 18 years were reported.",1
"During that period, the incidence was 0.15-0.88 cases per 100,000 children per year and as high as 6 cases per 100,000 during regional outbreaks of influenza.",1
"Side effects include indigestion , diarrhea , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting , muscle cramps , and fatigue .",1
Memantine Namenda is another type of drug approved for the treatment of AD.,1
Possible side effects include agitation and anxiety .,1
"Other medicines may be needed to control aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors.",1
These are usually administered in very low doses.,1
It may be necessary to discontinue the use of any medications that make confusion worse.,1
"Such medicines may include painkillers , cimetidine , central nervous system depressants , antihistamines , sleeping pills, and others.",1
Never change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your doctor.,1
"Supplement therapy Many people take folate vitamin B9 , vitamin B12 , and vitamin E .",1
"However, there is no strong evidence that taking these vitamins prevents AD or slows the progression of the disease once it occurs.",1
Some people believe that the herb ginkgo biloba can prevent or slow the development of dementia .,1
"However, rigorous studies have failed to show that ingesting this herb lowers a persons odds of developing dementia .",1
Do not use ginkgo if you take blood-thinning medications like warfarin Coumadin or a class of antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAOIs .,1
"If you are considering taking any drugs or supplements, you should talk to your doctor first.",1
Remember that herbs and supplements available over the counter are not regulated by the FDA.,1

"Directions to Hospitals Treating Alzheimers disease Prevention Although there is no proven way to prevent AD , there are some practices that may be worth incorporating into your daily routine, particularly if you have a family history of dementia .",1
"Talk to your doctor before implementing any of these approaches, especially those that involve taking a medication or supplement .",1
Consume a low-fat diet .,1
"Eat cold-water fish like tuna, salmon, and mackerel rich in omega-3 fatty acids at least 2 to 3 times per week.",1
"Reduce your intake of linoleic acid , which is found in margarine, butter, and dairy products.",1
"Increase consumption of antioxidants like carotenoids , vitamin E , and vitamin C by eating plenty of darkly colored fruits and vegetables.",1
Maintain a normal blood pressure .,1
Stay mentally and socially active throughout your life.,1
"Consider taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs like ibuprofen Advil, Motrin, sulindac Clinoril, or indomethacin Indocin.",1
"Statins , a class of medications normally used for the treatment of high cholesterol , may help lower your risk of AD.",1
Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of using these medications for preventive purposes.,1
"In addition, early testing of a vaccine against AD is currently underway.",1
The trajectory of AD is different for each person.,1
"If AD develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly.",1
"Patients with AD often die earlier than normal, although a patient may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after being diagnosed.",1
The final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years.,1
"During that time, the patient becomes immobile and totally disabled.",1
"Picks disease is a rare and permanent form of dementia that is similar to Alzheimers disease , except that it tends to affect only certain areas of the brain.",1
What are the symptoms of Picks disease.,1
The disease gets worse slowly.,1
Tissues in the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain start to shrink over time .,1
"Symptoms such as behavior changes, speech difficulty, and impaired thinking occur slowly, but continue to get worse.",1
The early personality changes can help doctors tell Picks disease apart from Alzheimer‚ .,1
"Memory loss is often the main, and earliest, symptom of Alzheimers.",1
People with Picks disease tend to behave the wrong way in different social settings.,1
The changes in behavior continue to get worse and are often one of the most disturbing symptoms of the disease.,1
"Some patients will have more prominent difficulty with decision making, complex tasks, or language trouble finding or understanding words or writing.",1
General symptoms are listed below.,1
"Behavioral changes: Cant keep a job Compulsive behaviors Inappropriate behavior Inability to function or interact in social or personal situations Problems with personal hygiene Repetitive behavior Withdrawal from social interaction Emotional changes: Abrupt mood changes Decreased interest in daily living activities Failure to recognize changes in behavior Failure to show emotional warmth, concern, empathy, sympathy Inappropriate mood Not caring about events or environment Language changes: Cant speak mutism Decreased ability to read or write Difficulty finding a word Difficulty speaking or understanding speech aphasia Repeat anything spoken to them echolalia Shrinking vocabulary Weak, uncoordinated speech sounds Neurological problems: Increased muscle tone rigidity Memory loss that gets worse Movement/coordination difficulties apraxia Weakness Other problems: Urinary incontinence What causes Picks disease.",1
People with Picks disease have abnormal substances called Pick bodies and Pick cells inside nerve cells in the damaged areas of the brain.,1
Pick bodies and Pick cells contain an abnormal form of a protein called tau.,1
This protein is found in all nerve cells.,1
But some people with Picks disease have an abnormal amount or type of this protein.,1
The exact cause of the abnormal form of the protein is unknown.,1
Many different abnormal genes have been found that can cause Pick‚ disease.,1
Many cases of Picks disease are passed down through families.,1
Picks disease is rare.,1
"It can occur in people as young as 20, but usually begins between ages 40 and 60.",1
The average age at which it begins is 54.,1
When to seek urgent medical care.,1
Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of Picks disease.,1
Call your health care provider or go to the emergency room if mental function gets worse which may mean that another disorder has developed.,1
Diagnosis The doctor will ask you about your medical history and symptoms.,1
"Your health care provider might order tests to help rule out other causes of dementia , including dementia due to metabolic causes.",1
"Picks disease is tentatively diagnosed based on symptoms and results of tests, including: Assessment of the mind and behavior neuropsychological assessment Brain MRI Electroencephalogram EEG Examination of the brain and nervous system neurological exam Examination of the fluid around the central nervous system cerebrospinal fluid after a lumbar puncture Head CT scan Tests of sensation, thinking and reasoning cognitive function, and motor function A brain biopsy is the only test that can confirm the diagnosis .",1
Treatment options There is no specific treatment for Picks disease.,1
"Certain antidepressants and antipsychotics may help manage mood swings related to Picks disease, but further research is needed.",1
"Sometimes patients with Picks take the same medications used to treat other types of dementia , such as medications that decrease the breakdown of the chemical messenger , acetylcholine anticholinesterase inhibitors , and memantine .",1
"However, there is no conclusive evidence that these help.",1
"In some cases, stopping or changing medications that worsen confusion or that are not essential can improve thinking and other cognitive functions.",1
This may include medications such as: Analgesics Anticholinergics Central nervous system depressants Cimetidine Lidocaine Its important to treat any disorders that contribute to confusion .,1
These may include: Anemia Decreased oxygen hypoxia levels Heart failure High carbon dioxide levels Infections Kidney failure Liver failure Nutritional disorders Thyroid disorders Psychiatric conditions such as depression Treating any medical and psychiatric disorders often helps improve mental function .,1
"Medications may be needed to control aggressive, dangerous, or agitated behaviors.",1
"Some patients may benefit from hearing aids, glasses, cataract surgery , or other treatments.",1
Behavior modification can help some people control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors.,1
This consists of rewarding appropriate or positive behaviors and ignoring inappropriate behaviors when its safe to do so.,1
"Formal psychotherapy treatment doesnt always work, because it can cause further confusion or disorientation.",1
"Reality orientation , which reinforces environmental and other cues, may help reduce disorientation.",1
"Depending on the symptoms and severity of the disease, the patient may need monitoring and help with personal hygiene and self-care .",1
"Eventually, there may be a need for 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in a special facility.",1
Family counseling can help the person cope with the changes needed for home care.,1
Care may include: Adult protective services Community resources Homemakers Visiting nurses or aides Volunteer services People may need legal advice early in the course of the disorder .,1
"Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions can make it easier to make ethical decisions regarding the care of the person with Picks disease.",1
Where to find medical care for Picks disease.,1
Directions to Hospitals Treating Picks disease What to expect Outlook/Prognosis.,1
The disorder quickly and steadily becomes worse.,1
Patients become totally disabled early in the course of the disease.,1
"Picks disease commonly causes death within 2 - 10 years , usually from infection but sometimes from general failure of the body systems.",1
Possible complications Abuse by an over-stressed caregiver Infection Loss of ability to care for self or perform normal activities Loss of ability to interact with others Progressive loss of ability to function Side effects of medications used to treat the disorder Reduced life span Prevention There is no known prevention.,1
