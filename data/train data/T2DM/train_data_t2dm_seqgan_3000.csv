"Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin.",1
 Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar glucose to enter cells to produce energy.,1
" Different factors, including genetics and some viruses, may contribute to type 1 diabetes.",1
" Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults.",1
" Despite active research, type 1 diabetes has no cure.",1
" Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels with insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.",1
 Type 1 diabetes signs and symptoms can appear relatively suddenly and may include Increased thirst Frequent urination Bed-wetting in children who previously didnt wet the bed during the night Extreme hunger Unintended weight loss Irritability and other mood changes Fatigue and weakness Blurred vision Consult your doctor if you notice any of the above signs and symptoms in you or your child.,1
 The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown.,1
" Usually, the bodys own immune system ‚ which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses ‚ mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing islet, or islets of Langerhans cells in the pancreas.",1
" Other possible causes include Genetics Exposure to viruses and other environmental factors Once a significant number of islet cells are destroyed, youll produce little or no insulin.",1
 Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach pancreas.,1
 The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.,1
" Insulin circulates, allowing sugar to enter your cells.",1
 Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.,1
" As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.",1
 Glucose ‚ a sugar ‚ is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.,1
 Glucose comes from two major sources food and your liver.,1
" Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.",1
 Your liver stores glucose as glycogen.,1
" When your glucose levels are low, such as when you havent eaten in a while, the liver breaks down the stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose levels within a normal range.",1
" In type 1 diabetes, theres no insulin to let glucose into the cells, so sugar builds up in your bloodstream.",1
 This can cause life-threatening complications.,1
 Some known risk factors for type 1 diabetes include Family history.,1
 Anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition.,1
 Diabetes can affect your emotions both directly and indirectly.,1
" Poorly controlled blood sugar can directly affect your emotions by causing behavior changes, such as irritability.",1
 There may be times you feel resentful about your diabetes.,1
" People with diabetes have an increased risk of depression and diabetes-related distress, which may be why many diabetes specialists regularly include a social worker or psychologist as part of their diabetes care team.",1
 You may find that talking to other people with type 1 diabetes is helpful.,1
 Support groups are available both online and in person.,1
" Group members often know about the latest treatments and tend to share their own experiences or helpful information, such as where to find carbohydrate counts for your favorite takeout restaurant.",1
" If youre interested in a support group, your doctor may be able to recommend one in your area.",1
 Or you can visit the websites of the American Diabetes Association ADA or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation JDRF for support group information and to check out local activities for people with type 1 diabetes.,1
 You can also reach the ADA at 800-DIABETES 800-342-2383 or JDRF at 800-533-CURE 800-533-2873.,1
" If you suspect that you or your child might have type 1 diabetes, get evaluated immediately.",1
 A simple blood test can let your doctor know if you need further evaluation and treatment.,1
" After diagnosis, youll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar level stabilizes.",1
 A doctor who specializes in hormonal disorders endocrinologist generally coordinates diabetes care.,1
" Your health care team will likely include Certified diabetes educator Dietitian Social worker or mental health professional Pharmacist Dentist Certified diabetes educator Doctor who specializes in eye care ophthalmologist Doctor who specializes in foot health podiatrist Once youve learned the basics of managing type 1 diabetes, your endocrinologist likely will recommend checkups every few months.",1
" A thorough yearly exam and regular foot and eye exams also are important ‚ especially if youre having a hard time managing your diabetes, if you have high blood pressure or kidney disease, or if youre pregnant.",1
 These tips can help you prepare for your appointments and know what to expect from your doctor.,1
 Write down any questions you have as they occur.,1
" Once you begin insulin treatment, the initial symptoms of diabetes should go away.",1
" However, you may have new issues that you need to address, such as recurring low blood sugar episodes or how to address high blood sugar after eating certain foods.",1
" Write down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.",1
" Many factors can affect your diabetes control, including stress.",1
" Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements youre taking.",1
" For your regular checkups, bring a book with your recorded glucose values or your meter to your appointments.",1
 Write down questions to ask your doctor.,1
 Preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time with your doctor and the rest of your health care team.,1
" For type 1 diabetes, topics you want to clarify with your doctor, dietitian or diabetes educator include The frequency and timing of blood glucose monitoring Insulin therapy types of insulin used, timing of dosing, amount of dose Insulin administration ‚ shots versus a pump Low blood sugar ‚ how to recognize and treat High blood sugar ‚ how to recognize and treat Ketones ‚ testing and treatment Nutrition ‚ types of food and their effect on blood sugar Carbohydrate counting Exercise ‚ adjusting insulin and food intake for activity Medical management ‚ how often to visit the doctor and other diabetes care specialists Sick day management Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, including How comfortable are you managing your diabetes.",1
 How frequent are your low blood sugar episodes.,1
" After 80-90% of the beta cells are destroyed, hyperglycemia develops and diabetes may be diagnosed.",1
" Patients need exogenous insulin to reverse this catabolic condition, prevent ketosis, decrease hyperglucagonemia, and normalize lipid and protein metabolism.",1
" Currently, autoimmunity is considered the major factor in the pathophysiology of type 1 DM.",1
" In a genetically susceptible individual, viral infection may stimulate the production of antibodies against a viral protein that trigger an autoimmune response against antigenically similar beta cell molecules.",1
" Approximately 85% of type 1 DM patients have circulating islet cell antibodies, and the majority also have detectable anti-insulin antibodies before receiving insulin therapy.",1
" The most commonly found islet cell antibodies are those directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD, an enzyme found within pancreatic beta cells.",1
" The prevalence of type 1 DM is increased in patients with other autoimmune diseases, such as Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and Addison disease.",1
 Pilia et al found a higher prevalence of islet cell antibodies IA2 and anti-GAD antibodies in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis.,1
" A study by Philippe et al used computed tomography CT scans, glucagon stimulation test results, and fecal elastase-1 measurements to confirm reduced pancreatic volume in individuals with DM.",1
" This finding, which was equally present in both type 1 and type 2 DM, may also explain the associated exocrine dysfunction that occurs in DM.",1
 Polymorphisms of the class II human leukocyte antigen HLA genes that encode DR and DQ are the major genetic determinants of type 1 DM.,1
 Approximately 95% of patients with type 1 DM have either HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4.,1
 Heterozygotes for those haplotypes are at significantly greater risk for DM than homozygotes.,1
 HLA-DQs are also considered specific markers of type 1 DM susceptibility.,1
" In contrast, some haplotypes eg, HLA-DR2 confer strong protection against type 1 DM.",1
 Sensory and autonomic neuropathy in people with diabetes are caused by axonal degeneration and segmental demyelination.,1
" Many factors are involved, including the accumulation of sorbitol in peripheral sensory nerves from sustained hyperglycemia.",1
 Motor neuropathy and cranial mononeuropathy result from vascular disease in blood vessels supplying nerves.,1
" Using nailfold video capillaroscopy, Barchetta et al detected a high prevalence of capillary changes in patients with diabetes, particularly those with retinal damage.",1
 This reflects a generalized microvessel involvement in both type 1 and type 2 DM.,1
 Microvascular disease causes multiple pathologic complications in people with diabetes.,1
" Hyaline arteriosclerosis, a characteristic pattern of wall thickening of small arterioles and capillaries, is widespread and is responsible for ischemic changes in the kidney, retina, brain, and peripheral nerves.",1
 Atherosclerosis of the main renal arteries and their intrarenal branches causes chronic nephron ischemia.,1
 It is a significant component of multiple renal lesions in diabetes.,1
 Vitamin D deficiency is an important independent predictor of development of coronary artery calcification in individuals with type 1 DM.,1
 Joergensen et al determined that vitamin D deficiency in type 1 diabetes may predict all causes of mortality but not development of microvascular complications.,1
" In the kidneys, the characteristic wall thickening of small arterioles and capillaries leads to diabetic nephropathy, which is characterized by proteinuria, glomerular hyalinization Kimmelstiel-Wilson, and chronic renal failure.",1
" Exacerbated expression of cytokines such as tumor growth factor beta 1 is part of the pathophysiology of glomerulosclerosis, which begins early in the course of diabetic nephropathy.",1
 Genetic factors influence the development of diabetic nephropathy.,1
 Single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting the factors involved in its pathogenesis appear to influence the risk for diabetic nephropathy in different people with type 1 DM.,1
" In areas where rates of type 2 DM and obesity are high, individuals with type 1 DM may share genetic and environmental factors that lead to their exhibiting type 2 features such as reduced insulin sensitivity.",1
 This condition is termed double diabetes.,1
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar glucose ‚ an important source of fuel for your body.,1
"With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin ‚ a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells ‚ or doesnt produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.",1
"Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but today more children are being diagnosed with the disorder, probably due to the rise in childhood obesity.",1
"Theres no cure for type 2 diabetes, but losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease.",1
"If diet and exercise arent enough to manage your blood sugar well, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy.",1
Signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly.,1
"In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it.",1
"Look for Increased thirst Frequent urination Increased hunger Unintended weight loss Fatigue Blurred vision Slow-healing sores Frequent infections Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck See your doctor if you notice type 2 diabetes symptoms.",1
Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin.,1
"Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as being overweight and inactive, seem to be contributing factors.",1
Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach pancreas.,1
The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.,1
"The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.",1
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.,1
"As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.",1
Glucose ‚ a sugar ‚ is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.,1
Glucose comes from two major sources food and your liver.,1
"Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.",1
Your liver stores and makes glucose.,1
"When your glucose levels are low, such as when you havent eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range.",1
"In type 2 diabetes, this process doesnt work well.",1
"Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.",1
"As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and cant make enough insulin to meet the bodys demands.",1
"In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin.",1
Factors that may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes include Weight.,1
 Being overweight is a main risk factor for type 2 diabetes.,1
"However, you dont have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes.",1
"To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits.",1
"Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem.",1
Avoiding being sedentary for long periods.,1
 Sitting still for long periods can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes.,1
Try to get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes.,1
Sometimes medication is an option as well.,1
"Metformin Glucophage, Glumetza, others, an oral diabetes medication, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.",1
"But even if you take medication, healthy lifestyle choices remain essential for preventing or managing diabetes.",1
"Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like theyve never experienced.",1
See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.,1
Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed using the Glycated hemoglobin A1C test.,1
 This blood test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months.,1
"Normal levels are below 5.7 percent, and a result between 5.7 and 6.4 percent is considered prediabetes.",1
An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests means you have diabetes.,1
"If the A1C test isnt available, or if you have certain conditions ‚ such as an uncommon form of hemoglobin known as a hemoglobin variant ‚ that interfere with A1C test, your doctor may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes Random blood sugar test.",1
 Blood sugar values are expressed in milligrams per deciliter mg/dL or millimoles per liter mmol/L.,1
"Regardless of when you last ate, a blood sample showing that your blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL 11.1 mmol/L or higher suggests diabetes, especially if you also have signs and symptoms of diabetes, such as frequent urination and extreme thirst.",1
Fasting blood sugar test.,1
 A blood sample is taken after an overnight fast.,1
A reading of less than 100 mg/dL 5.6 mmol/L is normal.,1
A level from 100 to 125 mg/dL 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L is considered prediabetes.,1
"If your fasting blood sugar is 126 mg/dL 7 mmol/L or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.",1
Oral glucose tolerance test.,1
" This test is less commonly used than the others, except during pregnancy.",1
Youll need to fast overnight and then drink a sugary liquid at the doctors office.,1
Blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours.,1
A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL 7.8 mmol/L is normal.,1
A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL 7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L indicates prediabetes.,1
A reading of 200 mg/dL 11.1 mmol/L or higher after two hours suggests diabetes.,1
"The American Diabetes Association recommends routine screening for type 2 diabetes beginning at age 45, especially if youre overweight.",1
"If the results are normal, repeat the test every three years.",1
"If the results are borderline, ask your doctor when to come back for another test.",1
"Screening is also recommended for people who are under 45 and overweight if there are other heart disease or diabetes risk factors present, such as a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of type 2 diabetes, a personal history of gestational diabetes or blood pressure above 140/90 millimeters of mercury mm Hg.",1
"If youre diagnosed with diabetes, the doctor may do other tests to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes ‚ since the two conditions often require different treatments.",1
A1C levels need to be checked between two and four times a year.,1
"Discuss your target A1C goal with your doctor, as it may vary depending on your age and other factors.",1
"For most people, the American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C level below 7 percent.",1
"An elevated A1C level may signal the need for a change in your medication, meal plan or activity level.",1
"In addition to the A1C test, your doctor will measure your blood pressure and take blood and urine samples periodically to check your cholesterol levels, thyroid function, liver function and kidney function.",1
Regular eye and foot exams also are important.,1
"Management of type 2 diabetes includes Weight loss Healthy eating Regular exercise Possibly, diabetes medication or insulin therapy Blood sugar monitoring These steps will help keep your blood sugar level closer to normal, which can delay or prevent complications.",1
Losing weight can lower your blood sugar levels.,1
"Losing just 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can make a difference, although a sustained weight loss of 7 percent or more of your initial weight seems to be ideal.",1
That means someone who weighs 180 pounds 82 kilograms would need to lose a little less than 13 pounds 5.9 kilograms to make an impact on blood sugar levels.,1
Controlling portions and eating healthy foods are simple ways to start taking weight off.,1
"Contrary to popular perception, theres no specific diabetes diet.",1
"However, its important to center your diet around Fewer calories Fewer refined carbohydrates, especially sweets Fewer foods containing saturated fats More vegetables and fruits More foods with fiber A registered dietitian can help you put together a meal plan that fits your health goals, food preferences and lifestyle.",1
He or she can also teach you how to monitor your carbohydrate intake and let you know about how many carbohydrates you need to eat with your meals and snacks to keep your blood sugar levels more stable.,1
"Everyone needs regular aerobic exercise, and people who have type 2 diabetes are no exception.",1
Get your doctors OK before starting an exercise program.,1
"Choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming and biking, so that you can make them part of your daily routine.",1
Aim for at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate or 15 to 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days of the week.,1
"A combination of exercises ‚ aerobic exercises, such as walking or dancing on most days, combined with resistance training, such as weightlifting or yoga twice a week ‚ offers more benefits than either type of exercise alone.",1
Remember that physical activity lowers blood sugar.,1
Check your blood sugar level before any activity.,1
You might need to eat a snack before exercising to help prevent low blood sugar if you take diabetes medications that lower your blood sugar.,1
"Its also important to reduce the amount of time you spend in inactive activities, such as watching TV.",1
Try to move around a bit every 30 minutes.,1
"Depending on your treatment plan, you may need to check and record your blood sugar level every now and then or, if youre on insulin, multiple times a day.",1
Ask your doctor how often he or she wants you to check your blood sugar.,1
Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range.,1
"Some people who have type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone, but many also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy.",1
"The decision about which medications are best depends on many factors, including your blood sugar level and any other health problems you have.",1
Your doctor might combine drugs from different classes to help you control your blood sugar in several different ways.,1
"Examples of possible treatments for type 2 diabetes include Metformin Glucophage, Glumetza, others.",1
" Generally, metformin is the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes.",1
It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving your bodys sensitivity to insulin so that your body uses insulin more effectively.,1
Nausea and diarrhea are possible side effects of metformin.,1
These side effects may go away as your body gets used to the medicine or if you take the medicine with a meal.,1
"If metformin and lifestyles changes arent enough to control your blood sugar level, other oral or injected medications can be added.",1
Sulfonylureas.,1
 These medications help your body secrete more insulin.,1
"Examples include glyburide DiaBeta, Glynase, glipizide Glucotrol and glimepiride Amaryl.",1
Possible side effects include low blood sugar and weight gain.,1
Meglitinides.,1
" These medications ‚ such as repaglinide Prandin and nateglinide Starlix ‚ work like sulfonylureas by stimulating the pancreas to secrete more insulin, but theyre faster acting, and the duration of their effect in the body is shorter.",1
They also have a risk of causing low blood sugar and weight gain.,1
Thiazolidinediones.,1
" Like metformin, these medications ‚ including rosiglitazone Avandia and pioglitazone Actos ‚ make the bodys tissues more sensitive to insulin.",1
"These drugs have been linked to weight gain and other more-serious side effects, such as an increased risk of heart failure and anemia.",1
"Because of these risks, these medications generally arent first-choice treatments.",1
DPP-4 inhibitors.,1
" These medications ‚ sitagliptin Januvia, saxagliptin Onglyza and linagliptin Tradjenta ‚ help reduce blood sugar levels, but tend to have a very modest effect.",1
"They dont cause weight gain, but may cause joint pain and increase your risk of pancreatitis.",1
GLP-1 receptor agonists.,1
 These injectable medications slow digestion and help lower blood sugar levels.,1
Their use is often associated with weight loss.,1
Possible side effects include nausea and an increased risk of pancreatitis.,1
"Exenatide Byetta, Bydureon, liraglutide Victoza and semaglutide Ozempic are examples of GLP-1 receptor agonists.",1
Recent research has shown that liraglutide and semaglutide may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people at high risk of those conditions.,1
 Some people who have type 2 diabetes need insulin therapy.,1
"In the past, insulin therapy was used as a last resort, but today its often prescribed sooner because of its benefits.",1
Low blood sugar hypoglycemia is a possible side effect of insulin.,1
"Normal digestion interferes with insulin taken by mouth, so insulin must be injected.",1
"Depending on your needs, your doctor may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use throughout the day and night.",1
"There are many types of insulin, and they each work in a different way.",1
"Often, people with type 2 diabetes start using insulin with one long-acting shot at night, such as insulin glargine Lantus or insulin detemir Levemir.",1
Discuss the pros and cons of different drugs with your doctor.,1
"Together you can decide which medication is best for you after considering many factors, including costs and other aspects of your health.",1
"In addition to diabetes medications, your doctor might prescribe low-dose aspirin therapy as well as blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering medications to help prevent heart and blood vessel disease.",1
"If you have type 2 diabetes and your body mass index BMI is greater than 35, you may be a candidate for weight-loss surgery bariatric surgery.",1
"Dramatic improvements in blood sugar levels are often seen in people with type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery, depending on the procedure performed.",1
Surgeries that bypass a portion of the small intestine have more of an effect on blood sugar levels than do other weight-loss surgeries.,1
"Surgery drawbacks include its high cost and risks, including a small risk of death.",1
It also requires drastic lifestyle changes.,1
Long-term complications may include nutritional deficiencies and osteoporosis.,1
Women with type 2 diabetes may need to alter their treatment during pregnancy.,1
Many women will require insulin therapy during pregnancy.,1
"Cholesterol-lowering medications, aspirin and some blood pressure drugs cant be used during pregnancy.",1
"If you have diabetic retinopathy, it may worsen during pregnancy.",1
Visit your ophthalmologist during the first trimester of your pregnancy and at one year postpartum.,1
"Because so many factors can affect your blood sugar, problems sometimes arise that require immediate care, such as High blood sugar hyperglycemia.",1
" Lots of things can cause your blood sugar to rise, including eating too much, being sick or not taking enough glucose-lowering medication.",1
"Watch for signs and symptoms of high blood sugar ‚ frequent urination, increased thirst, dry mouth, blurred vision, fatigue and nausea ‚ and check your blood sugar if necessary.",1
Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome HHNS.,1
 This life-threatening condition includes a blood sugar reading higher than 600 mg/dL 33.3 mmol/L.,1
Your blood sugar meter may not provide an accurate reading at this level or it may just read high.,1
"HHNS can cause dry mouth, extreme thirst, drowsiness, confusion, dark urine and convulsions.",1
HHNS is caused by sky-high blood sugar that turns blood thick and syrupy.,1
"It tends to be more common in older people with type 2 diabetes, and its often preceded by an illness or infection.",1
Call your doctor or seek immediate medical care if you have signs or symptoms of this condition.,1
Increased ketones in your urine diabetic ketoacidosis.,1
" If your cells are starved for energy, your body may begin to break down fat.",1
"This produces toxic acids known as ketones, which occur more commonly in people with type 1 diabetes.",1
"Watch for thirst or a very dry mouth, frequent urination, vomiting, shortness of breath, fatigue and fruity-smelling breath, and if you notice these signs and symptoms, consult your doctor right away or seek emergency care.",1
Low blood sugar hypoglycemia.,1
" If your blood sugar level drops below your target range, its known as low blood sugar hypoglycemia.",1
"Your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons, including skipping a meal, unintentionally taking more medication than usual or getting more physical activity than normal.",1
"Watch for signs and symptoms of low blood sugar ‚ sweating, shakiness, weakness, hunger, irritability, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, heart palpitations, slurred speech, drowsiness and confusion.",1
"If you have signs or symptoms of low blood sugar, drink or eat something that will quickly raise your blood sugar level ‚ fruit juice, glucose tablets, hard candy, regular not diet soda or another source of sugar.",1
Retest your blood in 15 minutes to be sure your blood glucose levels have normalized.,1
"If they havent, treat again and retest in another 15 minutes.",1
"If you lose consciousness, a family member or close contact may need to give you an emergency injection of glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the release of sugar into the blood.",1
"Explore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.",1
Careful management of type 2 diabetes can reduce your risk of serious ‚ even life-threatening ‚ complications.,1
Consider these tips Commit to managing your diabetes.,1
 Learn all you can about type 2 diabetes.,1
Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine.,1
"Establish a relationship with a diabetes educator, and ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.",1
"In severe cases, low blood sugar may cause you to pass out.",1
Hypoglycemia can be caused by too much insulin or not enough food.,1
Exercising too vigorously or drinking too much alcohol can have the same effect.,1
"Anyone who has diabetes is at risk of a diabetic coma, but the following factors can increase the risk Insulin delivery problems.",1
" If youre on an insulin pump, you have to check your blood sugar frequently.",1
Insulin delivery can stop if the pump fails or the tubing catheter is twisted or falls out of place.,1
A lack of insulin can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.,1
"An illness, trauma or surgery.",1
" When youre sick or injured, blood sugar levels tend to rise, sometimes dramatically.",1
This may cause diabetic ketoacidosis if you have type 1 diabetes and dont increase your insulin dosage to compensate.,1
"Medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure or kidney disease, also may increase your risk of diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.",1
Poorly managed diabetes.,1
" If you dont monitor your blood sugar properly or take your medications as directed, youll have a higher risk of developing long-term complications and a diabetic coma.",1
Deliberately skipping meals or insulin.,1
"If you feel the symptoms of extremely high or low blood sugar, call 911 or your local emergency number to make sure help is on the way before you pass out.",1
"If youre with someone with diabetes who has passed out or is acting strange, possibly as if he or she has had too much alcohol, call for immediate medical help.",1
"If you have no training in diabetes care, wait for the emergency care team to arrive.",1
"If you are familiar with diabetes care, test the unconscious persons blood sugar and follow these steps If the blood sugar level is lower than 70 mg/dL 3.9 mmol/L, give the person an injection of glucagon.",1
Do not try to give fluids to drink and do not give insulin to someone with low blood sugar.,1
If the blood sugar level is above 70 mg/dL 3.9 mmol/L wait for medical help to arrive.,1
Dont give sugar to someone whose blood sugar isnt low.,1
"If you called for medical help, let the emergency care team know about the diabetes and what steps youve taken, if any.",1
Diabetes is a long-term chronic disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.,1
Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar.,1
"Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.",1
"To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy.",1
Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream.,1
Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.,1
An organ called the pancreas makes insulin.,1
"The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.",1
" People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood.",1
This is because either Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes.,1
The causes and risk factors are different for each type Type 1 diabetes is less common.,1
"It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults.",1
"In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin.",1
This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working.,1
Daily injections of insulin are needed.,1
The exact cause of the failure to make enough insulin is unknown.,1
Type 2 diabetes is more common.,1
"It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.",1
Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.,1
"With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesnt use insulin as well as it should.",1
Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.,1
"There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.",1
 Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.,1
"If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.",1
"A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including Blurry vision Excess thirst Fatigue Frequent urination Hunger Weight loss Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.",1
Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period.,1
People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.,1
"After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems.",1
"These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include Eye problems , including trouble seeing especially at night, light sensitivity, and blindness Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot Damage to nerves in the body , causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunctionKidney problems , which can lead to kidney failure Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke A urine analysis may show high blood sugar.",1
But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.,1
Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL 11.1 mmol/L.,1
"To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.",1
Blood tests Fasting blood glucose level .,1
Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is higher than 126 mg/dL 7.0 mmol/L on two different tests.,1
