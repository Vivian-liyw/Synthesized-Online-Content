"Acne conglobata is a highly inflammatory disease presenting with comedones, nodules, abscesses, and draining sinus tracts.This condition generally begins between the ages of 18 and 30.",0
"It usually persists for a very long time, and often until the patient is around 40 years old.",0
" Although it often occurs where there is already an active acne problem, it can also happen to people whose acne has subsided.",0
" Although the cause of this type of acne is unknown, it is associated with testosterone and thus appears mainly in men.",0
 It can be caused by anabolic steroid abuse and sometimes appears in men after stopping testosterone therapy.,0
" It can also happen to someone who has a tumor that is releasing large amounts of androgens, or to people in remission from diseases, such as leukemia.",0
"In certain persons, the condition may be triggered by exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons or ingestion of halogens.",0
" Presentation Acne conglobata presents with blackheads appearing around the face, neck, chest, upper arms and buttocks in groups of two or three.",0
Pimples form around the blackheads; they are large and engorged with fluid and may be sensitive to touch.,0
 They remain for a while and continue to grow and fill with pus until they eventually rupture.,0
"After the lesion has drained, it fills up again.",0
"Blood tests allow for hundreds of allergens to be screened from a single sample, and cover food allergies as well as inhalants.",0
"However, non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.",0
"Other widely promoted tests such as the antigen leukocyte cellular antibody test and the food allergy profile are considered unproven methods, the use of which is not advised.",0
Food challenges test for allergens other than those caused by IgE allergens.,0
"The allergen is given to the person in the form of a pill, so the person can ingest the allergen directly.",0
 The person is watched for signs and symptoms.,0
"The problem with food challenges is that they must be performed in the hospital under careful watch, due to the possibility of anaphylaxis.Food challenges, especially double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, are the gold standard for diagnosis of food allergies, including most non-IgE-mediated reactions, but is rarely done.",0
"Blind food challenges involve packaging the suspected allergen into a capsule, giving it to the patient, and observing the patient for signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.The recommended method for diagnosing food allergy is to be assessed by an allergist.",0
The allergist will review the patient's history and the symptoms or reactions that have been noted after food ingestion.,0
"If the allergist feels the symptoms or reactions are consistent with food allergy, he/she will perform allergy tests.",0
"Additional diagnostic tools for evaluation of eosinophilic or non-IgE mediated reactions include endoscopy, colonoscopy, and biopsy.",0
" Differential diagnosis Important differential diagnoses are:  Lactose intolerance generally develops later in life, but can present in young patients in severe cases.",0
"It is due to an enzyme deficiency (lactase) and not allergy, and occurs in many non-Western people.",0
Celiac disease.,0
"While it is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten (present in wheat, rye, barley and oats), is not an allergy nor simply an intolerance, but a chronic, multiple-organ autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the small intestine.",0
"Irritable bowel syndrome C1 Esterase inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema), a rare disease, generally causes attacks of angioedema, but can present solely with abdominal pain and occasional diarrhea.",0
" Prevention Breastfeeding for more than four months may prevent atopic dermatitis, cow's milk allergy, and wheezing in early childhood.",0
Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective.,0
"Specifically, early exposure to eggs and peanuts reduces the risk of allergies to these.",0
Guidelines suggest introducing peanuts as early as 4‚Äì6 months and include precautionary measures for high-risk infants.,0
"The former guidelines, advising delaying the introduction of peanuts, are now thought to have contributed to the increase in peanut allergy seen recently.To avoid an allergic reaction, a strict diet can be followed.",0
"It is difficult to determine the amount of allergenic food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted.",0
" In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens through skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, blood transfusions, cosmetics, and alcohol.",0
" Inhalation exposure Allergic reactions to airborne particles or vapors of known food allergens have been reported as an occupational consequence of people working in the food industry, but can also take place in home situations, restaurants, or confined spaces such as airplanes.",0
"According to two reviews, respiratory symptoms are common, but in some cases there has been progression to anaphylaxis.",0
"The most frequent reported cases of reactions by inhalation of allergenic foods were due to peanut, seafood, legumes, tree nut, and cow's milk.",0
"Steam rising from cooking of lentils, green beans, chickpeas and fish has been well documented as triggering reactions, including anaphylactic reactions.",0
"One review mentioned case study examples of allergic responses to inhalation of other foods, including examples in which oral consumption of the food is tolerated.",0
 Treatment The mainstay of treatment for food allergy is total avoidance of the foods identified as allergens.,0
" An allergen can enter the body by consuming a food containing the allergen, and can also be ingested by touching any surfaces that may have come into contact with the allergen, then touching the eyes or nose.",0
"For people who are extremely sensitive, avoidance includes avoiding touching or inhaling the problematic food.",0
Total avoidance is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see regulation of labelling).,0
"If the food is accidentally ingested and a systemic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs, then epinephrine should be used.",0
A second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions.,0
" The person should then be transported to the emergency room, where additional treatment can be given.",0
 Other treatments include antihistamines and steroids.,0
 Epinephrine Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).,0
"If administered in a timely manner, epinephrine can reverse its effects.",0
"Epinephrine relieves airway swelling and obstruction, and improves blood circulation; blood vessels are tightened and heart rate is increased, improving circulation to body organs.",0
 Epinephrine is available by prescription in an autoinjector.,0
" Antihistamines Antihistamines can alleviate some of the milder symptoms of an allergic reaction, but do not treat all symptoms of anaphylaxis.",0
" Antihistamines block the action of histamine, which causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky to plasma proteins.",0
Histamine also causes itchiness by acting on sensory nerve terminals.,0
 The most common antihistamine given for food allergies is diphenhydramine.,0
 Steroids Glucocorticoid steroids are used to calm down the immune system cells that are attacked by the chemicals released during an allergic reaction.,0
" This treatment in the form of a nasal spray should not be used to treat anaphylaxis, for it only relieves symptoms in the area in which the steroid is in contact.",0
 Another reason steroids should not be used is the delay in reducing inflammation.,0
" Steroids can also be taken orally or through injection, by which every part of the body can be reached and treated, but a long time is usually needed for these to take effect.",0
" Epidemiology The most common food allergens account for about 90% of all allergic reactions; in adults they include shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and egg.",0
"In children, they include milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts.",0
"Six to 8% of children under the age of three have food allergies and nearly 4% of adults have food allergies.For reasons not entirely understood, the diagnosis of food allergies has apparently become more common in Western nations recently.",0
"One possible explanation for this is the old friends hypothesis which suggests that non disease causing organisms, such as helminths, could protect against allergy.",0
"Therefore, reduced exposure to these organisms, particularly in developed countries, could have contributed towards the increase.In the United States, food allergy affects as many as 5% of infants less than three years of age and 3% to 4% of adults.",0
"A similar prevalence is found in Canada.About 75% of children who have allergies to milk protein are able to tolerate baked-in milk products, i.e., muffins, cookies, cake, and hydrolyzed formulas.About 50% of children with allergies to milk, egg, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, and wheat will outgrow their allergy by the age of 6.",0
"Those who are still allergic by the age of 12 or so have less than an 8% chance of outgrowing the allergy.Peanut and tree nut allergies are less likely to be outgrown, although evidence now shows that about 20% of those with peanut allergies and 9% of those with tree nut allergies will outgrow them.In Japan, allergy to buckwheat flour, used for soba noodles, is more common than peanuts, tree nuts or foods made from soy beans.",0
" United States In the United States, an estimated 12 million people have food allergies.",0
Food allergy affects as many as 5% of infants less than three years of age and 3% to 4% of adults.,0
The prevalence of food allergies is rising.,0
"Food allergies cause roughly 30,000 emergency room visits and 150 deaths per year.",0
" Society and culture Whether rates of food allergy are increasing or not, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their caregivers.",0
"In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus.",0
"The Culinary Institute of America, a premier school for chef training, has courses in allergen-free cooking and a separate teaching kitchen.",0
School systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into the school.,0
"Despite all these precautions, people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can easily occur at other peoples' houses, at school or in restaurants.",0
Food fear has a significant impact on quality of life.,0
"For children with allergies, their quality of life is also affected by actions of their peers.",0
"There is an increased occurrence of bullying, which can include threats or acts of deliberately being touched with foods they need to avoid, also having their allergen-free food deliberately contaminated.",0
"In the 2018 animated/live action movie Peter Rabbit, rabbits used blackberries to deliberately induce an anaphylactic allergy response in a farmer who is trying to protect his garden.",0
"After many public protests, Sony Pictures and the director apologized for making light of food allergies.",0
" Regulation of labelling In response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain priority allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods.",0
 The priority allergens vary by country.,0
" There are no labeling laws mandating declaration of the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross-contamination, except in Brazil.",0
" Ingredients intentionally added In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains any of these eight major food allergens, added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat.",0
(In October 2018 the US FDA issued a request for information for the consideration of labeling for sesame to help protect people who have sesame allergies.) The eight-ingredient is list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission.,0
"To meet FALCPA labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its food sourced name in parentheses, for example Casein (milk), or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: Contains milk (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling).",0
"The European Union requires listing for those eight major allergens plus molluscs, celery, mustard, lupin, sesame and sulfites.FALCPA applies to packaged foods regulated by the FDA, which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages.",0
"However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients.",0
"These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name.",0
"Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like Contains: milk, are mandatory according to FSIS.",0
 FALCPA also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants.,0
"The EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 ‚Äì requires food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, for example, in catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars.In the United States, there is no federal mandate to address the presence of allergens in drug products.",0
FALCPA does not apply to medicines nor to cosmetics.,0
 Trace amounts as a result of cross-contamination The value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial.,0
"This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross-contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.).",0
"Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated.Labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling (PAL), also known as ‚Äúmay contain‚Äù statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production.",0
"PAL labeling can be confusing to consumers, especially as there can be many variations on the wording of the warning.",0
PAL is optional in the United States.,0
"As of 2014, PAL is regulated only in Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa.",0
"Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010, and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products.",0
"South Africa does not permit the use of PAL, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment and despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice.",0
In Australia and New Zealand there is a recommendation that PAL be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling).,0
A review identified the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population as ED01.,0
"This threshold reference dose for foods (such as cow's milk, egg, peanut and other proteins) will provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labeling and give consumers a better idea of might be accidentally in a food product beyond may contain.",0
"VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry sponsored, non-government organization.",0
"The European Union has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but is not expected to publish such before 2024.In Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts.",0
"These allergens include wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybrids, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybean, milk of all species of mammalians, almonds, hazelnuts, cashew nuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecan nuts, pistachios, pine nuts, and chestnuts.",0
" Genetically modified food There are concerns that genetically modified foods, also described as foods sourced from genetically modified organisms (GMO), could be responsible for allergic reactions, and that the widespread acceptance of GMO foods may be responsible for what is a real or perceived increase in the percentage of people with allergies.",0
There is a scientific consensus that available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food.,0
A 2016 U.S.,0
"National Academy of Sciences report concluded that there is no relationship between consumption of GM foods and the increase in prevalence of food allergies.One concern is that genetic engineering could make an allergy-provoking food more allergic, meaning that smaller portions would suffice to set off a reaction.",0
"Of the food currently in widespread GMO use, only soybeans are identified as a common allergen.",0
"However, for the soybean proteins known to trigger allergic reactions, there is more variation from strain to strain than between those and the GMO varieties.",0
Another concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic.,0
"Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.Prior to a new GMO food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met.",0
These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic.,0
Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins.,0
Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins.,0
Genes approved for animal use can be restricted from human consumption due to potential for allergic reactions.,0
"In 1998 Starlink brand corn restricted to animals was detected in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall.",0
"There are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing GMO ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (much there exists in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).",0
"In the US, the FDA Food Code states that the person in charge in restaurants should have knowledge about major food allergens, cross-contacts, and symptoms of food allergy reactions.",0
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis in which there is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine.,0
Typically the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected.,0
Occasionally other joints such as the shoulders or hips are involved.,0
Eye and bowel problems may also occur.,0
"Back pain is a characteristic symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes.",0
"Stiffness of the affected joints generally worsens over time.Although the cause of ankylosing spondylitis is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.",0
More than 85% of those affected in the UK have a specific human leukocyte antigen known as the HLA-B27 antigen.,0
The underlying mechanism is believed to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory.,0
Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms with support from medical imaging and blood tests.,0
"AS is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy, meaning that tests show no presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies.",0
It is also within a broader category known as axial spondyloarthritis.There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis.,0
Treatments may improve symptoms and prevent worsening.,0
"This may include medication, exercise, physical therapy, surgery in rare cases.",0
"Medications used include NSAIDs, steroids, DMARDs such as sulfasalazine, and biologic agents such as TNF inhibitors.Between 0.1% and 1.8% of people are affected.",0
Onset is typically in young adults.,0
Males and females are equally affected.,0
It used to be thought that three times as many men as women had the disease.,0
This was based on a diagnosis of the disease using x-ray.,0
"Men are more likely than women to experience changes to the bones and fusion, and thus they were being picked up using x-ray.",0
Over time MRI‚Äôs were developed which could identify inflammation.,0
Women are more likely than men to experience inflammation rather than fusion.,0
"source  The condition was first fully described in the late 1600s by Bernard Connor, but skeletons with ankylosing spondylitis are found in Egyptian mummies.",0
"The word is from Greek ankylos meaning to unite or grow together, spondylos meaning vertebra, and -itis meaning inflammation.",0
" Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset being between 20 and 30 years of age.",0
Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back.,0
"Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.As the disease progresses, loss of spinal mobility and chest expansion, with a limitation of anterior flexion, lateral flexion, and extension of the lumbar spine, are seen.",0
"Systemic features are common, with weight loss, fever, or fatigue often present.",0
"Pain is often severe at rest but may improve with physical activity, but inflammation and pain to varying degrees may recur regardless of rest and movement.",0
"AS can occur in any part of the spine or the entire spine, often with pain referred to one or the other buttock or the back of the thigh from the sacroiliac joint.",0
 Arthritis in the hips and shoulders may also occur.,0
"When the condition presents before the age of 18, it is more likely to cause pain and swelling of large lower limb joints, such as the knees.",0
"In prepubescent cases, pain and swelling may also manifest in the ankles and feet where heel pain and enthesopathy commonly develop.",0
"Less commonly ectasia of the sacral nerve root sheaths may occur.About 30% of people with AS will also experience anterior uveitis, causing eye pain, redness, and blurred vision.",0
This is thought to be due to the association that both AS and uveitis have with the inheritance of the HLA-B27 antigen.,0
"Cardiovascular involvement may include inflammation of the aorta, aortic valve insufficiency or disturbances of the heart's electrical conduction system.",0
Lung involvement is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the upper portion of the lung.,0
" Pathophysiology Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a systemic rheumatic disease, meaning it affects the entire body.",0
1‚Äì2% of individuals with the HLA-B27 genotype develop the disease.,0
"Approximately 85% of people with AS express the HLA-B27 genotype, meaning there is a strong genetic association.",0
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF Œ±) and IL-1 are also implicated in ankylosing spondylitis.,0
Autoantibodies specific for AS have not been identified.,0
"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are associated with AS, but do not correlate with disease severity.Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A/G variant rs10440635 close to the PTGER4 gene on human chromosome 5 has been associated with an increased number of cases of ankylosing spondylitis in a population recruited from the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada.",0
"The PTGER4 gene codes for the prostaglandin EP4 receptor (EP4), one of four receptors for prostaglandin E2.",0
"Activation of EP4 promotes bone remodeling and deposition (see EP4, bone) and EP4 is highly expressed at vertebral column sites involved in ankylosing spondylitis.",0
"These findings suggest that excessive EP4 activation contributes to pathological bone remodeling and deposition in ankylosing spondylitis and that the A/G variant rs10440635a of PTGER4 predisposes to this disease, possibly by influencing EP4's production or expression pattern.The association of AS with HLA-B27 suggests the condition involves CD8 T cells, which interact with HLA-B.",0
"This interaction is not proven to involve a self-antigen, and at least in the related reactive arthritis, which follows infections, the antigens involved are likely to be derived from intracellular microorganisms.",0
"There is, however, a possibility that CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in an aberrant way, since HLA-B27 appears to have a number of unusual properties, including possibly an ability to interact with T cell receptors in association with CD4 (usually CD8+ cytotoxic T cell with HLAB antigen as it is a MHC class 1 antigen).",0
"Bamboo spine develops when the outer fibers of the fibrous ring (anulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis) of the intervertebral discs ossify, which results in the formation of marginal syndesmophytes between adjoining vertebrae.",0
 Diagnosis Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis.,0
"Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into (1) radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and (2) non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis) While ankylosing spondylitis can be diagnosed through the description of radiological changes in the sacroiliac joints and spine, there are currently no direct tests (blood or imaging) to unambiguously diagnose early forms of ankylosing spondylitis (non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis).",0
"Diagnosis of non-radiologic axial spondyloarthritis is therefore more difficult and is based on the presence of several typical disease features.These diagnostic criteria include:  Inflammatory back pain:Chronic, inflammatory back pain is defined when at least four out of five of the following parameters are present: (1) Age of onset below 40 years old, (2) insidious onset, (3) improvement with exercise, (4) no improvement with rest, and (5) pain at night (with improvement upon getting up) Past history of inflammation in the joints, heels, or tendon-bone attachments Family history for axial spondyloarthritis or other associated rheumatic/autoimmune conditions Positive for the biomarker HLA-B27 Good response to treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Signs of elevated inflammation (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) Manifestation of psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, or inflammation of the eye (uveitis)If these criteria still do not give a compelling diagnosis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful.",0
MRI can show inflammation of the sacroiliac joint.,0
 Radiographic features The earliest changes in the sacroiliac joints demonstrable by plain x‚Äìray shows erosions and sclerosis.,0
Progression of the erosions leads to pseudo-widening of the joint space and bony ankylosis.,0
X-ray spine can reveal squaring of vertebrae with spine ossification with fibrous band run longitudinally called syndesmophyte while producing bamboo spine appearance.,0
"A drawback of X-ray diagnosis is the signs and symptoms of AS have usually been established as long as 8‚Äì10 years prior to X-ray-evident changes occurring on a plain film X-ray, which means a delay of as long as 10 years before adequate therapies can be introduced.",0
"Options for earlier diagnosis are tomography and MRI of the sacroiliac joints, but the reliability of these tests is still unclear.",0
,0
"In other words, some people with AS have normal levels of CRP and ESR, despite experiencing a significant amount of inflammation in their bodies.",0
" Genetic testing Variations of the HLA-B gene increase the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis, although it is not a diagnostic test.",0
Those with the HLA-B27 variant are at a higher risk than the general population of developing the disorder.,0
"HLA-B27, demonstrated in a blood test, can occasionally help with diagnosis, but in itself is not diagnostic of AS in a person with back pain.",0
"Over 85% of people that have been diagnosed with AS are HLA-B27 positive, although this ratio varies from population to population (about 50% of African Americans with AS possess HLA-B27 in contrast to the figure of 80% among those with AS who are of Mediterranean descent).",0
" BASDAI The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), developed in Bath (UK), is an index designed to detect the inflammatory burden of active disease.",0
"The BASDAI can help to establish a diagnosis of AS in the presence of other factors such as HLA-B27 positivity, persistent buttock pain which resolves with exercise, and X-ray or MRI-evident involvement of the sacroiliac joints.",0
It can be easily calculated and accurately assesses the need for additional therapy; a person with AS with a score of four out of a possible 10 points while on adequate NSAID therapy is usually considered a good candidate for biologic therapy.,0
"The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a functional index which can accurately assess functional impairment due to the disease, as well as improvements following therapy.",0
"The BASFI is not usually used as a diagnostic tool, but rather as a tool to establish a current baseline and subsequent response to therapy.",0
 Children Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis (JAS) is a rare form of the disease which differs from the more common adult form.,0
Enthesophathy and arthritis of large joints of the lower extremities is more common than the characteristic early-morning back pain seen in adult AS.,0
"Ankylosing tarsitis of the ankle is a common feature, as is the more classical findings of seronegative ANA and RF as well as presence of the HLA-B27 allele.",0
"Primary engagement of the appendicular joints may explain delayed diagnosis, however other common symptoms of AS such as uveitis, diarrhea, pulmonary disease and heart valve disease may lead suspicion away from other juvenile spondyloarthropathies.",0
 Schober's test The Schober's test is a useful clinical measure of flexion of the lumbar spine performed during the physical examination.,0
" Treatment There is no cure for AS, although treatments and medications can reduce symptoms and pain.",0
 Medication The major types of medications used to treat ankylosing spondylitis are pain-relievers and drugs aimed at stopping or slowing the progression of the disease.,0
All of these have potentially serious side effects.,0
"Pain-relieving drugs come in two major classes:  The mainstay of therapy in all seronegative spondyloarthropathies are anti-inflammatory drugs, which include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, phenylbutazone, diclofenac, indomethacin, naproxen and COX-2 inhibitors, which reduce inflammation and pain.",0
2012 research showed that those with AS and elevated levels of acute phase reactants seem to benefit most from continuous treatment with NSAIDs.Medications used to treat the progression of the disease include the following:  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as sulfasalazine can be used in people with peripheral arthritis.,0
"For axial involvement, evidence does not support sulfasalazine.",0
"Other DMARDS, such as methotrexate, did not have enough evidence to prove their effect.",0
"Generally, systemic corticosteroids were not used due to lack of evidence.",0
Local injection with corticosteroid can be used for certain people with peripheral arthritis.,0
"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFŒ±) blockers (antagonists), such as the biologics etanercept, infliximab, golimumab and adalimumab, have shown good short-term effectiveness in the form of profound and sustained reduction in all clinical and laboratory measures of disease activity.",0
Trials are ongoing to determine their long-term effectiveness and safety.,0
The major drawback is the cost.,0
"An alternative may be the newer, orally-administered non-biologic apremilast, which inhibits TNF-Œ± secretion, but a recent study did not find the drug useful for ankylosing spondylitis.",0
"Anti-interleukin-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab, currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, are also undergoing trials.",0
Interleukin-17A inhibitor secukinumab is an option for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis that has responded inadequately to (TNFŒ±) blockers.,0
" Surgery In severe cases of AS, surgery can be an option in the form of joint replacements, particularly in the knees and hips.",0
"Surgical correction is also possible for those with severe flexion deformities (severe downward curvature) of the spine, particularly in the neck, although this procedure is considered very risky.",0
"In addition, AS can have some manifestations which make anesthesia more complex.",0
"Changes in the upper airway can lead to difficulties in intubating the airway, spinal and epidural anesthesia may be difficult owing to calcification of ligaments, and a small number of people have aortic insufficiency.",0
"The stiffness of the thoracic ribs results in ventilation being mainly diaphragm-driven, so there may also be a decrease in pulmonary function.",0
" Physical therapy Though physical therapy remedies have been scarcely documented, some therapeutic exercises are used to help manage lower back, neck, knee, and shoulder pain.",0
"Some therapeutic exercises include: Low intensity aerobic exercise Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) Thermotherapy Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) Exercise programs, either at home or supervised Hydrotherapy Group exercises eg PilatesModerate-to-high impact exercises like jogging are generally not recommended or recommended with restrictions due to the jarring of affected vertebrae that can worsen pain and stiffness in some with AS.",0
 Prognosis Prognosis is related to disease severity.,0
AS can range from mild to progressively debilitating and from medically controlled to refractory.,0
"Some cases may have times of active inflammation followed by times of remission resulting in minimal disability while others never have times of remission and have acute inflammation and pain, leading to significant disability.",0
"As the disease progresses, it can cause the vertebrae and the lumbosacral joint to ossify, resulting in the fusion of the spine.",0
"This places the spine in a vulnerable state because it becomes one bone, which causes it to lose its range of motion as well as putting it at risk for spinal fractures.",0
This not only limits mobility but reduces the affected person's quality of life.,0
"Complete fusion of the spine can lead to a reduced range of motion and increased pain, as well as total joint destruction which could lead to a joint replacement.Osteoporosis is common in ankylosing spondylitis, both from chronic systemic inflammation and decreased mobility resulting from AS.",0
"Over a long-term period, osteopenia or osteoporosis of the AP spine may occur, causing eventual compression fractures and a back hump.",0
"Hyperkyphosis from ankylosing spondylitis can also lead to impairment in mobility and balance, as well as impaired peripheral vision, which increases the risk of falls which can cause fracture of already-fragile vertebrae.",0
Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine.,0
"In compression fractures of the vertebrae, paresthesia is a complication due to the inflammation of the tissue surrounding nerves.",0
"Organs commonly affected by AS, other than the axial spine and other joints, are the heart, lungs, eyes, colon, and kidneys.",0
"Other complications are aortic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block, and amyloidosis.",0
"Owing to lung fibrosis, chest X-rays may show apical fibrosis, while pulmonary function testing may reveal a restrictive lung defect.",0
Very rare complications involve neurologic conditions such as the cauda equina syndrome.,0
 Mortality Mortality is increased in people with AS and circulatory disease is the most frequent cause of death.,0
"People with AS have an increased risk of 60% for cerebrovascular mortality, and an overall increased risk of 50% for vascular mortality.",0
"About one third of those with ankylosing spondylitis have severe disease, which reduces life expectancy.As increased mortality in ankylosing spondylitis is related to disease severity, factors negatively affecting outcomes include: Male sex Plus 3 of the following in the first 2 years of disease: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >30 mm/h Unresponsive to NSAIDs Limitation of lumbar spine range of motion Sausage-like fingers or toes Oligoarthritis Onset <16 years old Gait The hunched position that often results from complete spinal fusion can have an effect on a person's gait.",0
Increased spinal kyphosis will lead to a forward and downward shift in center of mass (COM).,0
This shift in COM has been shown to be compensated by increased knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion.,0
"The gait of someone with ankylosing spondylitis often has a cautious pattern because they have decreased ability to absorb shock, and they cannot see the horizon.",0
 Epidemiology Between 0.1% and 1.8% of people are affected.,0
"The disease is most common in Northern European countries, and seen least in people of Afro-Caribbean descent.",0
"Although the ratio of male to female disease is reportedly 3:1, many rheumatologists believe the number of women with AS is underdiagnosed, as most women tend to experience milder cases of the disease.",0
"The majority of people with AS, including 95 percent of people of European descent with the disease, express the HLA-B27 antigen and high levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the blood.",0
" Research In 2007, a collaborative effort by an international team of researchers in the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States led to the discovery of two genes that also contribute to the cause of AS: ARTS-1 and IL23R.",0
"The findings were published in the November 2007 edition of Nature Genetics, a journal that emphasizes research on the genetic basis for common and complex diseases.",0
"Together with HLA-B27, these two genes account for roughly 70 percent of the overall number of cases of the disease.",0
" History Ankylosing spondylitis has a long history, having been distinguished from rheumatoid arthritis by Galen as early as the 2nd century AD.",0
"Skeletal evidence of the disease (ossification of joints and entheses primarily of the axial skeleton, known as bamboo spine) was thought to be found in the skeletal remains of a 5000-year-old Egyptian mummy with evidence of bamboo spine.",0
"However, a subsequent report found that this was not the case.The anatomist and surgeon Realdo Colombo described what could have been the disease in 1559, and the first account of pathologic changes to the skeleton possibly associated with AS was published in 1691 by Bernard Connor.",0
"In 1818, Benjamin Brodie became the first physician to document a person believed to have active AS who also had accompanying iritis.In 1858, David Tucker published a small booklet which clearly described the case of Leonard Trask, who suffered from severe spinal deformity subsequent to AS.",0
"In 1833, Trask fell from a horse, exacerbating the condition and resulting in severe deformity.",0
Tucker reported:  It was not until he [Trask] had exercised for some time that he could perform any labor ...,0
[H]is neck and back have continued to curve drawing his head downward on his breast.,0
"This account became the first documented case of AS in the United States, owing to its indisputable description of inflammatory disease characteristics of AS and the hallmark of deforming injury in AS.",0
"In the late nineteenth century, the neurophysiologist Vladimir Bekhterev of Russia in 1893, Adolph Str√ºmpell of Germany in 1897, and Pierre Marie of France in 1898 were the first to give adequate descriptions which permitted an accurate diagnosis of AS prior to severe spinal deformity.",0
"For this reason, AS is also known as Bekhterev disease, Bechterew's disease or Marie‚ÄìStr√ºmpell disease.",0
Aspergillosis is the name given to a wide variety of diseases caused by fungal infections from species of Aspergillus.,0
"Aspergillosis occurs in humans, birds and other animals.",0
Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct.,0
"Most cases of acute aspergillosis occur in people with severely compromised immune systems, e.g.",0
those undergoing bone marrow transplantation.,0
"Chronic colonization or infection can cause complications in people with underlying respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",0
"Most commonly, aspergillosis occurs in the form of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), aspergilloma, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).",0
Some forms are intertwined; for example ABPA and simple aspergilloma can progress to CPA.,0
"Other, noninvasive manifestations include fungal sinusitis (both allergic in nature and with established fungal balls), otomycosis (ear infection), keratitis (eye infection), and onychomycosis (nail infection).",0
"In most instances, these are less severe, and curable with effective antifungal treatment.",0
"The most frequently identified pathogens are Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus, ubiquitous organisms capable of living under extensive environmental stress.",0
Most people are thought to inhale thousands of Aspergillus spores daily but without effect due to an efficient immune response.,0
"Taken together, the major chronic, invasive, and allergic forms of aspergillosis account for around 600,000 deaths annually worldwide.",0
" Symptoms A fungus ball in the lungs may cause no symptoms and may be discovered only with a chest X-ray, or it may cause repeated coughing up of blood, chest pain, and occasionally severe, even fatal, bleeding.",0
"A rapidly invasive Aspergillus infection in the lungs often causes cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.",0
Poorly controlled aspergillosis can disseminate through the blood stream to cause widespread organ damage.,0
"Symptoms include fever, chills, shock, delirium, seizures, and blood clots.",0
"The person may develop kidney failure, liver failure (causing jaundice), and breathing difficulties.",0
Death can occur quickly.,0
Aspergillosis of the ear canal causes itching and occasionally pain.,0
Fluid draining overnight from the ear may leave a stain on the pillow.,0
Aspergillosis of the sinuses causes a feeling of congestion and sometimes pain or discharge.,0
"It can extend beyond the sinuses.In addition to the symptoms, an X-ray or computerised tomography (CT) scan of the infected area provides clues for making the diagnosis.",0
"Whenever possible, a doctor sends a sample of infected material to a laboratory to confirm identification of the fungus.",0
" Diagnosis On chest X-ray and CT, pulmonary aspergillosis classically manifests as a halo sign, and later, an air crescent sign.",0
"In hematologic patients with invasive aspergillosis, the galactomannan test can make the diagnosis in a noninvasive way.",0
"False-positive Aspergillus galactomannan tests have been found in patients on intravenous treatment with some antibiotics or fluids containing gluconate or citric acid such as some transfusion platelets, parenteral nutrition, or PlasmaLyte.",0
"On microscopy, Aspergillus species are reliably demonstrated by silver stains, e.g., Gridley stain or Gomori methenamine-silver.",0
These give the fungal walls a gray-black colour.,0
The hyphae of Aspergillus species range in diameter from 2.5 to 4.5 ¬µm.,0
"They have septate hyphae, but these are not always apparent, and in such cases they may be mistaken for Zygomycota.",0
Aspergillus hyphae tend to have dichotomous branching that is progressive and primarily at acute angles of around 45¬∞.,0
" Risk Factors People who are immunocompromised ‚Äî such as patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy for leukaemia, or AIDS ‚Äî are at an increased risk for invasive aspergillosis infections.",0
These people may have neutropenia or corticoid-induced immunosuppression as a result of medical treatments.,0
Neutropenia is often caused by extremely cytotoxic medications such as cyclophosphamide.,0
Cyclophosphamide interferes with cellular replication including that of white blood cells such as neutrophils.,0
A decreased neutrophil count inhibits the ability of the body to mount immune responses against pathogens.,0
"Although tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Œ±) ‚Äî a signaling molecule related to acute inflammation responses ‚Äî is produced, the abnormally low number of neutrophils present in neutropenic patients leads to a depressed inflammatory response.",0
" If the underlying neutropenia is not fixed, rapid and uncontrolled hyphal growth of the invasive fungi will occur and result in negative health outcomes.",0
 Prevention Prevention of aspergillosis involves a reduction of mold exposure via environmental infection-control.,0
Antifungal prophylaxis can be given to high-risk patients.,0
Posaconazole is often given as prophylaxis in severely immunocompromised patients.,0
 Screening A systematic review has evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in people with defective immune systems from medical treatment such as chemotherapy.,0
Evidence suggests PCR tests have moderate diagnostic accuracy when used for screening for invasive aspergillosis in high risk groups.,0
 Treatment The current medical treatments for aggressive invasive aspergillosis include voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B in combination with surgical debridement.,0
"For the less aggressive allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, findings suggest the use of oral steroids for a prolonged period of time, preferably for 6‚Äì9 months in allergic aspergillosis of the lungs.",0
"Itraconazole is given with the steroids, as it is considered to have a steroid-sparing effect, causing the steroids to be more effective, allowing a lower dose.",0
"Other drugs used, such as amphotericin B, caspofungin (in combination therapy only), flucytosine (in combination therapy only), or itraconazole, are used to treat this fungal infection.",0
"However, a growing proportion of infections are resistant to the triazoles.",0
"fumigatus, the most commonly infecting species, is intrinsically resistant to fluconazole.",0
" Epidemiology Aspergillosis is thought to affect more than  14 million people worldwide, with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA, >4 million), severe asthma with fungal sensitization (>6.5 million), and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA, ‚àº3 million) being considerably more prevalent than invasive aspergillosis (IA, >300,000).",0
"Other common conditions include Aspergillus bronchitis, Aspergillus rhinosinusitis (many millions), otitis externa, and  Aspergillus onychomycosis (10 million).",0
"Alterations in the composition and function of the lung microbiome and mycobiome have been associated with an increasing number of chronic pulmonary diseases such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma.",0
" Animals While relatively rare in humans, aspergillosis is a common and dangerous infection in birds, particularly in pet parrots.",0
" Mallards and other ducks are particularly susceptible, as they often resort to poor food sources during bad weather.",0
"Captive raptors, such as falcons and hawks, are susceptible to this disease if they are kept in poor conditions and especially if they are fed pigeons, which are often carriers of asper.",0
"It can be acute in chicks, but chronic in mature birds.",0
"In the United States, aspergillosis has been the culprit in several rapid die-offs among waterfowl.",0
" From 8 December until 14 December 2006, over 2,000 mallards died near Burley, Idaho, an agricultural community about 150 miles southeast of Boise.",0
 Mouldy waste grain from the farmland and feedlots in the area is the suspected source.,0
 A similar aspergillosis outbreak caused by mouldy grain killed 500 mallards in Iowa in 2005.,0
"While no connection has been found between aspergillosis and the H5N1 strain of avian influenza (commonly called bird flu), rapid die-offs caused by aspergillosis can spark fears of bird flu outbreaks.",0
 Laboratory analysis is the only way to distinguish bird flu from aspergillosis.,0
"In dogs, aspergillosis is an uncommon disease typically affecting only the nasal passages (nasal aspergillosis).",0
This is much more common in dolicocephalic breeds.,0
"It can also spread to the rest of the body; this is termed disseminated aspergillosis and is rare, usually affecting individuals with underlying immune disorders.",0
"In 2019, an outbreak of aspergillosis struck the rare kakapo, a large flightless parrot endemic to New Zealand.",0
"By June the disease had killed seven of the birds, whose total population at the time was only 142 adults and 72 chicks.",0
One fifth of the population was infected with the disease and the entire species was considered at risk of extinction.,0
Actinomycosis is a rare infectious bacterial disease caused by Actinomyces species.,0
About 70% of infections are due to either Actinomyces israelii or A.,0
Five-year survival rates in the United States are 68%.,0
"Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected.Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women.",0
"In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000 deaths.",0
This is about 8% of the total cases and total deaths from cancer.,0
About 70% of cervical cancers and 90% of deaths occur in developing countries.,0
"In low-income countries, it is one of the most common causes of cancer death.",0
"In developed countries, the widespread use of cervical screening programs has dramatically reduced rates of cervical cancer.",0
"In medical research, the most famous immortalized cell line, known as HeLa, was developed from cervical cancer cells of a woman named Henrietta Lacks.",0
 Signs and symptoms The early stages of cervical cancer may be completely free of symptoms.,0
"Vaginal bleeding, contact bleeding (one most common form being bleeding after sexual intercourse), or (rarely) a vaginal mass may indicate the presence of malignancy.",0
"Also, moderate pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge are symptoms of cervical cancer.",0
"In advanced disease, metastases may be present in the abdomen, lungs, or elsewhere.",0
"Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pelvic pain, back pain, leg pain, swollen legs, heavy vaginal bleeding, bone fractures, and (rarely) leakage of urine or feces from the vagina.",0
Bleeding after douching or after a pelvic exam is a common symptom of cervical cancer.,0
" Causes Infection with some types of HPV is the greatest risk factor for cervical cancer, followed by smoking.",0
HIV infection is also a risk factor.,0
"Not all of the causes of cervical cancer are known, however, and several other contributing factors have been implicated.",0
" Human papillomavirus HPV types 16 and 18 are the cause of 75% of cervical cancer cases globally, while 31 and 45 are the causes of another 10%.Women who have sex with men who have many other sexual partners or women who have many sexual partners have a greater risk.Of the 150-200 types of HPV known,  15 are classified as high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82), three as probable high-risk (26, 53, and 66), and 12 as low-risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and CP6108).Genital warts, which are a form of benign tumor of epithelial cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV.",0
"However, these serotypes are usually not related to cervical cancer.",0
"Having multiple strains at the same time is common, including those that can cause cervical cancer along with those that cause warts.",0
Infection with HPV is generally believed to be required for cervical cancer to occur.,0
" Smoking Cigarette smoking, both active and passive, increases the risk of cervical cancer.",0
"Among HPV-infected women, current and former smokers have roughly two to three times the incidence of invasive cancer.",0
"Passive smoking is also associated with increased risk, but to a lesser extent.Smoking has also been linked to the development of cervical cancer.",0
"Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer.",0
"A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) occurring, which has the potential of forming cervical cancer.",0
"When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer.",0
Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have more of a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all.,0
"Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV, which is the leading cause of this type of cancer.",0
"Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.",0
 Oral contraceptives Long-term use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risk of cervical cancer.,0
"Women who have used oral contraceptives for 5 to 9 years have about three times the incidence of invasive cancer, and those who used them for 10 years or longer have about four times the risk.",0
 Multiple pregnancies Having many pregnancies is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer.,0
"Among HPV-infected women, those who have had seven or more full-term pregnancies have around four times the risk of cancer compared with women with no pregnancies, and two to three times the risk of women who have had one or two full-term pregnancies.",0
" Diagnosis  Biopsy The Pap test can be used as a screening test, but produces a false negative in up to 50% of cases of cervical cancer.",0
"Other concerns is the cost of doing Pap tests, which make them unaffordable in many areas of the world.Confirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or precancer requires a biopsy of the cervix.",0
"This is often done through colposcopy, a magnified visual inspection of the cervix aided by using a dilute acetic acid (e.g.",0
"vinegar) solution to highlight abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix, with visual contrast provided by staining the normal tissues a mahogany brown with Lugol's iodine.",0
Medical devices used for biopsy of the cervix include punch forceps.,0
"Colposcopic impression, the estimate of disease severity based on the visual inspection, forms part of the diagnosis.",0
"Further diagnostic and treatment procedures are loop electrical excision procedure and cervical conization, in which the inner lining of the cervix is removed to be examined pathologically.",0
These are carried out if the biopsy confirms severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,0
" Often before the biopsy, the doctor asks for medical imaging to rule out other causes of woman's symptoms.",0
"Imaging modalities such as ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI have been used to look for alternating disease, spread of the tumor, and effect on adjacent structures.",0
"Typically, they appear as heterogeneous mass on the cervix.Interventions such as playing music during the procedure and viewing the procedure on a monitor can reduce the anxiety associated with the examination.",0
" Precancerous lesions Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, the potential precursor to cervical cancer, is often diagnosed on examination of cervical biopsies by a pathologist.",0
" For premalignant dysplastic changes, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grading is used.",0
The naming and histologic classification of cervical carcinoma precursor lesions has changed many times over the 20th century.,0
" The World Health Organization classification system was descriptive of the lesions, naming them mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ (CIS).",0
" The term cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was developed to place emphasis on the spectrum of abnormality in these lesions, and to help standardize treatment.",0
" It classifies mild dysplasia as CIN1, moderate dysplasia as CIN2, and severe dysplasia and CIS as CIN3.",0
" More recently, CIN2 and CIN3 have been combined into CIN2/3.",0
 These results are what a pathologist might report from a biopsy.,0
These should not be confused with the Bethesda system terms for Pap test (cytopathology) results.,0
 Among the Bethesda results: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).,0
" An LSIL Pap may correspond to CIN1, and HSIL may correspond to CIN2 and CIN3, but they are results of different tests, and the Pap test results need not match the histologic findings.",0
" Cancer subtypes Histologic subtypes of invasive cervical carcinoma include:  Though squamous cell carcinoma is the cervical cancer with the most incidence, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix has been increasing in recent decades.",0
Squamous cell carcinoma (about 80‚Äì85%) adenocarcinoma (about 15% of cervical cancers in the UK) Adenosquamous carcinoma Small cell carcinoma Neuroendocrine tumour Glassy cell carcinoma Villoglandular adenocarcinomaNoncarcinoma malignancies which can rarely occur in the cervix include melanoma and lymphoma.,0
 The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage does not incorporate lymph node involvement in contrast to the TNM staging for most other cancers.,0
"For cases treated surgically, information obtained from the pathologist can be used in assigning a separate pathologic stage, but is not to replace the original clinical stage.",0
" Staging Cervical cancer is staged by the FIGO system, which is based on clinical examination, rather than surgical findings.",0
"It allows only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization.",0
Liquid-based cytology may reduced the number of inadequate samples.,0
Pap test screening every three to five  years with appropriate follow-up can reduce cervical cancer incidence up to 80%.,0
"Abnormal results may suggest the presence of precancerous changes, allowing examination and possible preventive treatment, known as colposcopy.",0
The treatment of low-grade lesions may adversely affect subsequent fertility and pregnancy.,0
Personal invitations encouraging women to get screened are effective at increasing the likelihood they will do so.,0
"Educational materials also help increase the likelihood women will go for screening, but they are not as effective as invitations.According to the 2010 European guidelines, the age at which to start screening ranges between 20 and 30 years of age, but preferentially not before age 25 or 30 years, and depends on burden of the disease in the population and the available resources.In the United States, screening is recommended to begin at age 21, regardless of age at which a woman began having sex or other risk factors.",0
Pap tests should be done every three years between the ages of 21 and 65.,0
"In women over the age of 65, screening may be discontinued if no abnormal screening results were seen within the previous 10 years and no history of CIN2 or higher exists.",0
HPV vaccination status does not change screening rates.A number of recommended options exist for screening those 30 to 65.,0
"This includes cervical cytology every 3 years, HPV testing every 5 years, or HPV testing together with cytology every 5 years.",0
"Screening is not beneficial before age 25, as the rate of disease is low.",0
Screening is not beneficial in women older than 60 years if they have a history of negative results.,0
The American Society of Clinical Oncology  guideline has recommend for different levels of resource availability.Pap tests have not been as effective in developing countries.,0
"This is in part because many of these countries have an impoverished health care infrastructure, too few trained and skilled professionals to obtain and interpret Pap tests, uninformed women who get lost to follow-up, and a lengthy turn-around time to get results.",0
"Visual inspection with acetic acid and HPV DNA testing have been tried, though with mixed success.",0
" Barrier protection Barrier protection or spermicidal gel use during sexual intercourse decreases, but does not eliminate risk of transmitting the infection, though condoms may protect against genital warts.",0
" They also provide protection against other sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and Chlamydia, which are associated with greater risks of developing cervical cancer.",0
" Vaccination Three HPV vaccines (Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix) reduce the risk of cancerous or precancerous changes of the cervix and perineum by about 93% and 62%, respectively.",0
"The vaccines are between 92% and 100% effective against HPV 16 and 18 up to at least 8 years.HPV vaccines are typically given to age 9 to 26, as the vaccine is most effective if given before infection occurs.",0
The duration of effectiveness and whether a booster will be needed is unknown.,0
The high cost of this vaccine has been a cause for concern.,0
Several countries have considered (or are considering) programs to fund HPV vaccination.,0
"The American Society of Clinical Oncology  guideline has recommendations for different levels of resource availability.Since 2010, young women in Japan have been eligible to receive the cervical cancer vaccination for free.",0
"In June 2013, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare mandated that, before administering the vaccine, medical institutions must inform women that the ministry does not recommend it.",0
"However, the vaccine is still available at no cost to Japanese women who choose to accept the vaccination.",0
" Nutrition Vitamin A is associated with a lower risk as are vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-Carotene.",0
" Treatment The treatment of cervical cancer varies worldwide, largely due to access to surgeons skilled in radical pelvic surgery, and the emergence of fertility-sparing therapy in developed nations.",0
"Because cervical cancers are radiosensitive, radiation may be used in all stages where surgical options do not exist.",0
Surgical intervention may have better outcomes than radiological approaches.,0
"In addition, chemotherapy can be used to treat cervical cancer, and has been found to be more effective than radiation alone.",0
Evidence suggests chemoradiotherapy may increase overall survival and reduce the risk of disease recurrence compared to radiotherapy alone.,0
" Peri-operative care approaches, such as 'fast-track surgery' or 'enhanced recovery programmes' may lower surgical stress and improve recovery after gynaecological cancer surgery.Microinvasive cancer (stage IA) may be treated by hysterectomy (removal of the whole uterus including part of the vagina).",0
"For stage IA2, the lymph nodes are removed, as well.",0
Alternatives include local surgical procedures such as a loop electrical excision procedure  or cone biopsy.,0
A systematic review concluded that more evidence is needed to inform decisions about different surgical techniques for women with cervical cancer at stage IA2.,0
"If a cone biopsy does not produce clear margins (findings on biopsy showing that the tumor is surrounded by cancer free tissue, suggesting all of the tumor is removed), one more possible treatment option for women who want to preserve their fertility is a trachelectomy.",0
"This attempts to surgically remove the cancer while preserving the ovaries and uterus, providing for a more conservative operation than a hysterectomy.",0
"It is a viable option for those in stage I cervical cancer which has not spread; however, it is not yet considered a standard of care, as few doctors are skilled in this procedure.",0
"Even the most experienced surgeon cannot promise that a trachelectomy can be performed until after surgical microscopic examination, as the extent of the spread of cancer is unknown.",0
"If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the woman is under general anesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed.",0
This can only be done during the same operation if the woman has given prior consent.,0
"Due to the possible risk of cancer spread to the lymph nodes in stage 1B cancers and some stage 1A cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.A radical trachelectomy can be performed abdominally or vaginally and  opinions are conflicting as to which is better.",0
"A radical abdominal trachelectomy with lymphadenectomy usually only requires a two- to three-day hospital stay, and most women recover very quickly (about six weeks).",0
"Complications are uncommon, although women who are able to conceive after surgery are susceptible to preterm labor and possible late miscarriage.",0
A wait of at least one year is generally recommended before attempting to become pregnant after surgery.,0
Recurrence in the residual cervix is very rare if the cancer has been cleared with the trachelectomy.,0
"Yet, women are recommended to practice vigilant prevention and follow-up care including Pap screenings/colposcopy, with biopsies of the remaining lower uterine segment as needed (every 3‚Äì4 months for at least 5 years) to monitor for any recurrence in addition to minimizing any new exposures to HPV through safe sex practices until one is actively trying to conceive.Early stages (IB1 and IIA less than 4 cm) can be treated with radical hysterectomy with removal of the lymph nodes or radiation therapy.",0
Radiation therapy is given as external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and brachytherapy (internal radiation).,0
Women treated with surgery who have high-risk features found on pathologic examination are given radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy to reduce the risk of relapse.,0
" A Cochrane review has found moderate-certainty evidence that radiation decreases the risk of disease progression in people with stage IB cervical cancer, when compared to no further treatment.",0
"However, little evidence was found on its effects on overall survival.",0
" Larger early-stage tumors (IB2 and IIA more than 4 cm) may be treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires adjuvant radiation therapy), or cisplatin chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy.",0
"When cisplatin is present, it is thought to be the most active single agent in periodic diseases.",0
Such addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to chemoradiation seems not only to improve survival but also reduces risk of recurrence in women with early stage cervical cancer (IA2-IIA).,0
A Cochrane review found a lack of evidence on the benefits and harms of primary hysterectomy compared to primary chemoradiotherapy for  cervical cancer in stage IB2.Advanced-stage tumors (IIB-IVA) are treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy.,0
"On June 15, 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a combination of two chemotherapy drugs, hycamtin and cisplatin, for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment.",0
"Combination treatment has significant risk of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia side effects.There is insufficient evidence whether anticancer drugs after standard care help women with locally advanced cervical cancer to live longer.For surgery to be curative, the entire cancer must be removed with no cancer found at the margins of the removed tissue on examination under a microscope.",0
"This procedure is known as exenteration.No evidence is available to suggest that any form of follow‚Äêup approach is better or worse in terms of prolonging survival, improving quality of life or guiding the management of problems that can arise because of the treatment and that in the case of radiotherapy treatment worsen with time.",0
A 2019 review found no controlled trials regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for vaginal bleeding in women with advanced cervical cancer.,0
The chance of a survival rate is nearly 100% for women with microscopic forms of cervical cancer.,0
" With treatment, the five-year relative survival rate for the earliest stage of invasive cervical cancer is 92%, and the overall (all stages combined) five-year survival rate is about 72%.",0
Survival rates decrease to 30-40% for women with stage III cancer and 15% or fewer of those with stage IV cancer five years after diagnosis.,0
"Recurrent cervical cancer detected at its earliest stages might be successfully treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of the three.",0
About 35% of women with invasive cervical cancer have persistent or recurrent disease after treatment.,0
 By country Five year survival in the United States for White women is 69% and for Black women is 57%.Regular screening has meant that precancerous changes and early-stage cervical cancers have been detected and treated early.,0
"Figures suggest that cervical screening is saving 5,000 lives each year in the UK by preventing cervical cancer.",0
"About 1,000 women per year die of cervical cancer in the UK.",0
 All of the Nordic countries have cervical cancer-screening programs in place.,0
The Pap test was integrated into clinical practice in the Nordic countries in the 1960s.In Africa outcomes are often worse as diagnosis is frequently at a latter stage of disease.,0
" Epidemiology Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and deaths from cancer in women.",0
"In 2018, 570,000 cases of cervical cancer were estimated to have occurred, with over 300,000 deaths.",0
"It is the second-most common cause of female-specific cancer after breast cancer, accounting for around 8% of both total cancer cases and total cancer deaths in women.",0
About 80% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries.,0
"It is the most frequently detected cancer during pregnancy, with an occurrence of 1.5 to 12 for every 100,000 pregnancies.",0
 Australia Australia had 734 cases of cervical cancer in 2005.,0
 The number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer has dropped on average by 4.5% each year since organised screening began in 1991 (1991‚Äì2005).,0
"Regular twice-yearly Pap tests can reduce the incidence of cervical cancer up to 90% in Australia, and save 1,200 Australian women from dying from the disease each year.",0
 It is predicted that because of the success of the primary HPV testing programme there will be fewer than four new cases per 100 000 women annually by 2028.,0
" Canada In Canada, an estimated 1,300 women will have been diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2008 and 380 will have died.",0
" India In India, the number of people with cervical cancer is rising, but overall the age-adjusted rates are decreasing.",0
 Usage of condoms  in the female population has improved the survival of women with cancers of the cervix.,0
" European Union In the European Union, about 34,000 new cases per year and over 16,000 deaths due to cervical cancer occurred in 2004.",0
" United Kingdom Cervical cancer is the 12th-most common cancer in women in the UK (around 3,100 women were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and accounts for 1% of cancer deaths (around 920 died in 2012).",0
"With a 42% reduction from 1988‚Äì1997, the NHS-implemented screening programme has been highly successful, screening the highest-risk age group (25‚Äì49 years) every 3 years, and those ages 50‚Äì64 every 5 years.",0
" United States An estimated 13,170 new cervical cancers and 4,250 cervical cancer deaths will occur in the United States in 2019.",0
The median age at diagnosis is 50.,0
"The rates of new cases in the United States was 7.3 per 100,000 women, based on rates from 2012‚Äì2016.",0
"Cervical cancer deaths decreased by approximately 74% in the last 50 years, largely due to widespread Pap test screening.",0
The annual direct medical cost of cervical cancer prevention and treatment prior to introduction of the HPV vaccine was estimated at $6 billion.,0
" History 400 BCE ‚Äî Hippocrates noted that cervical cancer was incurable 1925 ‚Äî Hinselmann invented the colposcope 1928 ‚Äî Papanicolaou developed the Papanicolaou technique 1941 ‚Äî Papanicolaou and Traut: Pap test screening began 1946 ‚Äî Aylesbury spatula was developed to scrape the cervix, collecting the sample for the Pap test 1951 ‚Äî First successful in-vitro cell line, HeLa, derived from biopsy of cervical cancer of Henrietta Lacks 1976 ‚Äî Harald zur Hausen and Gisam found HPV DNA in cervical cancer and genital warts; Hausen later won the Nobel Prize for his work 1988 ‚Äî Bethesda System for reporting Pap results was developed 2006 ‚Äî First HPV vaccine was approved by the FDA 2015 ‚Äî HPV Vaccine shown to protect against infection at multiple body sites 2018 ‚Äî Evidence for single-dose protection with HPV vaccine Epidemiologists working in the early 20th century noted that cervical cancer behaved like a sexually transmitted disease.",0
In summary:  Cervical cancer was noted to be common in female sex workers.,0
"It was rare in nuns, except for those who had been sexually active before entering the convent.",0
(Rigoni in 1841) It was more common in the second wives of men whose first wives had died from cervical cancer.,0
It was rare in Jewish women.,0
"In 1935, Syverton and Berry discovered a relationship between RPV (Rabbit Papillomavirus) and skin cancer in rabbits.",0
(HPV is species-specific and therefore cannot be transmitted to rabbits)These historical observations suggested that cervical cancer could be caused by a sexually transmitted agent.,0
Initial research in the 1940s and 1950s attributed cervical cancer to smegma (e.g.,0
Heins et al.,0
1958).,0
During the 1960s and 1970s it was suspected that infection with herpes simplex virus was the cause of the disease.,0
"In summary, HSV was seen as a likely cause because it is known to survive in the female reproductive tract, to be transmitted sexually in a way compatible with known risk factors, such as promiscuity and low socioeconomic status.",0
"Herpes viruses were also implicated in other malignant diseases, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Marek's disease and the Luck√© renal adenocarcinoma.",0
HSV was recovered from cervical tumour cells.,0
"A description of human papillomavirus (HPV) by electron microscopy was given in 1949, and HPV-DNA was identified in 1963.",0
It was not until the 1980s that HPV was identified in cervical cancer tissue.,0
 It has since been demonstrated that HPV is implicated in virtually all cervical cancers.,0
"Specific viral subtypes implicated are HPV 16, 18, 31, 45 and others.",0
"In work that was initiated in the mid 1980s, the HPV vaccine was developed, in parallel, by researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center, the University of Rochester, the University of Queensland in Australia, and the U.S.",0
National Cancer Institute.,0
" In 2006, the U.S.",0
"Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first preventive HPV vaccine, marketed by Merck & Co.",0
under the trade name Gardasil.,0
" Society and culture  Australia In Australia, Aboriginal women are more than five times more likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Aboriginal women, suggesting that Aboriginal women are less likely to have regular Pap tests.",0
"There are several factors that may limit indigenous women from engaging in regular cervical screening practices, including sensitivity in discussing the topic in Aboriginal communities, embarrassment, anxiety and fear about the procedure.",0
"Difficulty in accessing screening services (for example, transport difficulties) and a lack of female GPs, trained Pap test providers and trained female Aboriginal Health Workers are also issues.The Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation (ACCF), founded in 2008, promotes 'women's health by eliminating cervical cancer and enabling treatment for women with cervical cancer and related health issues, in Australia and in developing countries.' Ian Frazer, one of the developers of the Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine, is the scientific advisor to ACCF.",0
"Janette Howard, the wife of former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1996, and first spoke on her battle with the disease in 2006.",0
 United States A 2007 survey of American women found 40% had heard of HPV infection and less than half of those knew it causes cervical cancer.,0
"Over a longitudinal study from 1975‚Äì2000, it was found that people of lower socioeconomic census brackets had higher rates of late-stage cancer diagnosis and higher morbidity rates.",0
"After controlling for stage, there still existed differences in survival rates.",0
"Klinefelter syndrome (KS), also known as 47, XXY is the set of symptoms that result from two or more X chromosomes in males.",0
The primary features are infertility and small poorly functioning testicles.,0
"Often, symptoms may be subtle and many people do not realize they are affected.",0
"Sometimes, symptoms are more prominent and may include weaker muscles, greater height, poor coordination, less body hair, breast growth, and less interest in sex.",0
Often it is only at puberty that these symptoms are noticed.,0
"Intelligence is usually normal; however, reading difficulties and problems with speech are more common.",0
"Symptoms are typically more severe if three or more X chromosomes are present (48,XXXY syndrome or 49,XXXXY syndrome).Klinefelter syndrome occurs randomly.",0
The extra X chromosome comes from the father and mother nearly equally.,0
An older mother may have a slightly increased risk of a child with KS.,0
The condition is not typically inherited from one's parents.,0
The underlying mechanisms involves at least one extra X chromosome in addition to a Y chromosome such that the total chromosome number is 47 or more rather than the usual 46.,0
"KS is diagnosed by the genetic test known as a karyotype.While no cure is known, a number of treatments may help.",0
"Physical therapy, speech and language therapy, counselling, and adjustments of teaching methods may be useful.",0
Testosterone replacement may be used in those who have significantly lower levels.,0
Enlarged breasts may be removed by surgery.,0
"About half of affected males have a chance of fathering children with the help of assisted reproductive technology, but this is expensive and not risk free.",0
"XXY males appear to have a higher risk of breast cancer than typical, but still lower than that of females.",0
"People with the condition have a nearly normal life expectancy.Klinefelter syndrome is one of the most common chromosomal disorders, occurring in one to two per 1,000 live male births.",0
"It is named after American endocrinologist Harry Klinefelter, who identified the condition in the 1940s.",0
"In 1956, identification of the extra X chromosome was first noticed.",0
"Mice can also have the XXY syndrome, making them a useful research model.",0
 Signs and symptoms The primary features are infertility and small poorly functioning testicles.,0
" Physical As babies and children, XXY males may have weaker muscles and reduced strength.",0
"As they grow older, they tend to become taller than average.",0
"They may have less muscle control and coordination than other boys of their age.During puberty, the physical traits of the syndrome become more evident; because these boys do not produce as much testosterone as other boys, they have a less muscular body, less facial and body hair, and broader hips.",0
"As teens, XXY males may develop breast tissue and also have weaker bones, and a lower energy level than other males.By adulthood, XXY males look similar to males without the condition, although they are often taller.",0
"In adults, possible characteristics vary widely and include little to no sign of affectedness, a lanky, youthful build and facial appearance, or a rounded body type with some degree of gynecomastia (increased breast tissue).",0
"Gynecomastia is present to some extent in about a third of affected individuals, a slightly higher percentage than in the XY population.",0
"About 10% of XXY males have gynecomastia noticeable enough that they may choose to have cosmetic surgery.Affected males are often infertile, or may have reduced fertility.",0
Advanced reproductive assistance is sometimes possible.The term hypogonadism in XXY symptoms is often misinterpreted to mean small testicles when it means decreased testicular hormone/endocrine function.,0
"Because of this (primary) hypogonadism, individuals often have a low serum testosterone level, but high serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels.",0
"Despite this misunderstanding of the term, however, XXY men may also have microorchidism (i.e., small testicles).The testicle size of affected males are usually less than 2 cm in length (and always shorter than 3.5 cm), 1 cm in width, and 4 ml in volume.XXY males are also more likely than other men to have certain health problems, such as autoimmune disorders, breast cancer, venous thromboembolic disease, and osteoporosis.",0
"In contrast to these potentially increased risks, rare X-linked recessive conditions are thought to occur less frequently in XXY males than in normal XY males, since these conditions are transmitted by genes on the X chromosome, and people with two X chromosomes are typically only carriers rather than affected by these X-linked recessive conditions.",0
" Cognitive and developmental Some degree of language learning or reading impairment may be present, and neuropsychological testing often reveals deficits in executive functions, although these deficits can often be overcome through early intervention.",0
"Also, delays in motor development may occur, which can be addressed through occupational and physical therapies.",0
"XXY males may sit up, crawl, and walk later than other infants; they may also struggle in school, both academically and with sports.",0
" Endocrine Men with Klinefelter's syndrome have testosterone levels that are significantly lower (‚àí260 ng/dL difference), estradiol levels that are slightly higher (+6.8 pg/mL) though not significantly different when restricted to high-accuracy assays (+5.5 pg/mL difference), and the ratio of estradiol to testosterone is significantly higher (+0.06).",0
 Cause Maternal age is the only known risk factor.,0
"Women at 40 years have a four times higher risk for a child with Klinefelter syndrome than women aged 24 years.The extra chromosome is retained because of a nondisjunction event during paternal meiosis I, maternal meiosis I, or maternal meiosis II (gametogenesis).",0
"The relevant nondisjunction in meiosis I occurs when homologous chromosomes, in this case the X and Y or two X sex chromosomes, fail to separate, producing a sperm with an X and a Y chromosome or an egg with two X chromosomes.",0
Fertilizing a normal (X) egg with this sperm produces an XXY offspring (Klinefelter).,0
Fertilizing a double X egg with a normal sperm also produces an XXY offspring (Klinefelter).Another mechanism for retaining the extra chromosome is through a nondisjunction event during meiosis II in the egg.,0
"Nondisjunction occurs when sister chromatids on the sex chromosome, in this case an X and an X, fail to separate.",0
"An XX egg is produced, which when fertilized with a Y sperm, yields an XXY offspring.",0
"This XXY chromosome arrangement is one of the most common genetic variations from the XY karyotype, occurring in about one in 500 live male births.",0
"The most common form of colon cancer is adenocarcinoma, constituting between 95% to 98% of all cases of colorectal cancer.",0
"Other, rarer types include lymphoma, adenosquamous and squamous cell carcinoma.",0
Some subtypes have been found to be more aggressive.,0
Immunohistochemistry may be used in uncertain cases.,0
 Staging Staging of the cancer is based on both radiological and pathological findings.,0
"As with most other forms of cancer, tumor staging is based on the TNM system which considers how much the initial tumor has spread and the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and more distant organs.",0
The AJCC 8th edition was published in 2018.,0
" Prevention It has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable.",0
"Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption decrease the risk.",0
" Lifestyle Lifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity.",0
"The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats.",0
This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies.,0
"However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions (outside of eating a healthy diet) will have significant protective effects.",0
"In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.With regard to dietary fiber, the 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but most studies have not borne this out, and status of the science remained unclear as of 2014.",0
"A 2019 review, however, found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains.",0
The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as probable as of 2017.Higher physical activity is recommended.,0
Physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk.,0
High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21%.,0
Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer.,0
"The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.",0
 Medication and supplements Aspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk.,0
"Aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old, do not have an increased risk of bleeding, and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer.",0
"It is not recommended in those at average risk.There is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation, but it is not sufficient to make a recommendation.",0
Vitamin D intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.,0
" Screening As more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention.",0
Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2‚Äì3 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms.,0
"Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer.",0
"Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.The three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy.",0
"Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found.",0
"Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiac-based or immunochemical.",0
"If abnormal FOBT results are found, participants are typically referred for a follow-up colonoscopy examination.",0
"When done once every 1-2 years, FOBT screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16% and among those participating in screening, colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23%, although it has not been proven to reduce all-cause mortality.",0
Immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing.Other options include virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening testing (FIT-DNA).,0
"Virtual colonoscopy via a CT scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths like standard colonoscopy can.",0
"Stool DNA screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions, including altered DNA and blood hemoglobin.",0
A positive result should be followed by colonoscopy.,0
FIT-DNA has more false positives than FIT and thus results in more adverse effects.,0
Further study is required as of 2016 to determine if a three-year screening interval is correct.,0
" Recommendations In the United States, screening is typically recommended between ages 50 to 75 years.",0
The American Cancer Society recommends starting at the age of 45.,0
"For those between 76 and 85 years old, the decision to screen should be individualized.",0
"For those at high risk, screenings usually begin at around 40.Several screening methods are recommended including stool-based tests every 2 years, sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with fecal immunochemical testing every two years, and colonoscopy every 10 years.",0
It is unclear which of these two methods is better.,0
"Colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon, but is associated with greater cost and more complications.",0
"For people with average risk who have had a high-quality colonoscopy with normal results, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy.",0
"For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, screening is not recommended.",0
It takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit.,0
"The USPSTF list seven potential strategies for screening, with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used.In Canada, among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk, fecal immunochemical testing or FOBT is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years.",0
"Colonoscopy is less preferred.Some countries have national colorectal screening programs which offer FOBT screening for all adults within a certain age group, typically starting between ages 50 to 60.",0
"Examples of countries with organised screening include the United Kingdom, Australia,  the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Taiwan.",0
 Treatment The treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation.,0
"The decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors, including the person's health and preferences, as well as the stage of the tumor.",0
"When colorectal cancer is caught early, surgery can be curative.",0
"However, when it is detected at later stages (for which metastases are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation, to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible.",0
" Surgery If the cancer is found at a very early stage, it may be removed during a colonoscopy using a variety of techniques including EMR and ESD.",0
"For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure.",0
The procedure of choice is a partial colectomy (or proctocolectomy for rectal lesions) where the affected part of the colon or rectum is removed along with parts of its mesocolon and blood supply to facilitate removal of draining lymph nodes.,0
"This can either be done by an open laparotomy or laparoscopically, depending on patient and lesion factors.",0
The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy.If there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs they may also be removed.,0
Sometimes chemotherapy is used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it.,0
The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs.,0
" Chemotherapy In both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases.",0
The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.,0
"In Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment.",0
"The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable, and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified.",0
It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy.,0
"For stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which is the case with stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy.",0
"If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial.",0
"If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative.",0
"Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used.",0
"Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT.",0
"The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication and fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine.",0
"Some specific regimens used for CRC are CAPOX, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI.",0
Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy.,0
"Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the two FDA approved ones are cetuximab and panitumumab.The primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy.",0
"Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately a colostomy is not required.",0
"However, it may not be possible in low lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required.",0
Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similar to stage IV colon cancer.,0
" Radiation therapy While a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer, its use in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation.",0
"Just as for chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting for some stages of rectal cancer.",0
"For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment.",0
 Immunotherapy Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been found to be useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability.,0
Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced CRC tumours that are MMR deficient and have failed usual treatments.,0
"Most people who do improve, however, still worsen after months or years.",0
Other types of colorectal cancer as of 2017 is still being studied.,0
" Palliative care Palliative care is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms.Involvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.In people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving quality of life.",0
"Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement.",0
"These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.",0
Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.,0
" Follow-up The aims of follow-up are to diagnose, in the earliest possible stage, any metastasis or tumors that develop later, but did not originate from the original cancer (metachronous lesions).",0
The U.S.,0
National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer.,0
"A medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years.",0
"Carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention.",0
"A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure).",0
"A colonoscopy can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months.",0
"If a villous polyp, a polyp >1 centimeter or high grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years.",0
"For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.",0
"Routine PET or ultrasound scanning, chest X-rays, complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended.For people who have undergone curative surgery or adjuvant therapy (or both) to treat non-metastatic colorectal cancer, intense surveillance and close follow-up have not been shown to provide additional survival benefits.",0
 Exercise Exercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors.,0
"In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality.",0
Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting.,0
These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and expression of biomarkers.,0
"Patients with tumors that lacked CTNNB1 expression (Œ≤-catenin), involved in Wnt signalling pathway, required more than 18 Metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality.",0
The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways.,0
"In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in patients with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy.",0
Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed.,0
A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of patients who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy.,0
"Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers.",0
A vascular ring is a congenital defect in which there is an abnormal formation of the aorta and/or its surrounding blood vessels.,0
"The trachea and esophagus are completely encircled and sometimes compressed by a ring formed by these vessels, which can lead to breathing and digestive difficulties.",0
Most often this is because of persistence of the double aortic arch after the second month of fetal life.,0
" Presentation The two arches surround the esophagus and trachea which, if sufficiently constrictive, may cause breathing or swallowing difficulties despite medical therapies.",0
A less common ring is present with a right aortic arch instead of the usual left-sided aortic arch.,0
This compresses the esophagus and trachea because of the persistence of a ductal ligament (from fetal circulation) that may connect between the aorta on the front and the left subclavian artery posteriorly going to the left arm.,0
" Diagnosis Infants with vascular rings typically present before 12 months with respiratory or esophageal symptoms like stridor, wheezing, cough, dysphagia, or difficulty feeding.",0
"The stridor improves with neck extension, differentiating from laryngomalacia which is relieved by prone or upright positioning, and will not be relieved with corticosteroids or epinephrine, unlike croup.",0
"Diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and can be confirmed with barium contrast esophagogram for those with esophageal symptoms, bronchoscopy, or CT or MRI.",0
Posterior urethral valve (PUV) disorder is an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and genitourinary system of male newborns.,0
A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in utero development.,0
It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns.,0
"The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases presenting late due to milder symptoms.",0
"More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring.",0
It occurs in about one in 8000 babies.,0
" Presentation  Complications Incontinence Urinary tract infection Renal failure Vesicoureteral reflux Chronic kidney disease Diagnosis Abdominal ultrasound is of some benefit, but not diagnostic.",0
" Features that suggest posterior urethral valves are bilateral hydronephrosis, a thickened bladder wall with thickened smooth muscle trabeculations, and bladder diverticula.Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is more specific for the diagnosis.",0
Normal plicae circularis are variable in appearance and often not seen on normal VCUGs.,0
" PUV on voiding cystourethrogram is characterized by an abrupt tapering of urethral caliber near the verumontanum, with the specific level depending on the developmental variant.",0
Vesicoureteral reflux is also seen in over 50% of cases.,0
Very often the posterior urethra maybe dilated thus making the abrupt narrowing more obvious.,0
"the bladder wall may show trabeculations or sacculations or even diverticuli.Diagnosis can also be made by cystoscopy, where a small camera is inserted into the urethra for direct visualization of the posteriorly positioned valve.",0
"A limitation of this technique is that posterior valve tissue is translucent and can be pushed against the wall of the urethra by inflowing irrigation fluid, making it difficult to visualize.",0
Cystoscopy may also demonstrate the bladder changes.,0
"Centers in Europe and Japan have also had excellent results with cystosonography, although it has not been approved for use in the United States yet.",0
 Classification Posterior urethral obstruction was first classified by H.,0

" The verumontanum, or mountain ridge, is a distinctive landmark in the prostatic urethra, important in the systemic division of posterior valve disorders:Type I - Most common type; due to anterior fusing of the plicae colliculi, mucosal fins extending from the bottom of the verumontanum distally along the prostatic and membranous urethra Type II - Least common variant; vertical or longitudinal folds between the verumontanum and proximal prostatic urethra and bladder neck Type III - Less common variant; a disc of tissue distal to verumontanum, also theorized  to be a developmental anomaly of congenital urogenital remnants in the bulbar urethraDewan has suggested that obstruction in the posterior urethra is more appropriately termed congenital obstructions of the posterior urethral membrane (COPUMs), a concept that has come from an in-depth analysis of the historical papers, and evaluation of patients with a prenatal diagnosis that has facilitated video recording of the uninstrumented obstructed urethra.",0
"The congenital obstructive lesions in the bulbar urethra, named Type III Valves by Young in 1919, have been eponymously referred to as Cobb's collar or Moorman's ring.",0
"For each of the COPUM (Posterior Urethra) and Cobb's (Bulbar Urethra) lesions, the degree of obstruction can be variable, consistent with a variable expression of the embryopathy.",0
" The now nearly one hundred year old nomenclature of posterior urethral valves was based on limited radiology and primitive endoscopy, thus a change COPUM or Cobb's has been appropriate.",0
" Treatment If suspected antenatally, a consultation with a paediatric surgeon/ paediatric urologist maybe indicated to evaluate the risk and consider treatment options.",0
Treatment is by endoscopic valve ablation.,0
"Fetal surgery is a high risk procedure reserved for cases with severe oligohydramnios, to try to limit the associated lung underdevelopment, or pulmonary hypoplasia, that is seen at birth in these patients.",0
"The risks of fetal surgery are significant and include limb entrapment, abdominal injury, and fetal or maternal death.",0
"Specific procedures for in utero intervention include infusions of amniotic fluid, serial bladder aspiration, and creating a connection between the amniotic sac and the fetal bladder, or vesicoamniotic shunt.There are three specific endoscopic treatments of posterior urethral valves:  Vesicostomy followed by valve ablation - a stoma, or hole, is made in the urinary bladder, also known as low diversion, after which the valve is ablated and the stoma is closed.",0
"Pyelostomy followed by valve ablation -  stoma is made in the pelvis of the kidney as a slightly high diversion, after which the valve is ablated and the stoma is closed Primary (transurethral) valve ablation - the valve is removed through the urethra without creation of a stomaThe standard treatment is primary (transurethral) ablation of the valves.",0
"Urinary diversion is used in selected cases, and its benefit is disputed.Following surgery, the follow-up in patients with posterior urethral valve syndrome is long term, and often requires a multidisciplinary effort between paediatric surgeons/ paediatric urologists, paediatric nephrologists, pulmonologists, neonatologists, radiologists and the family of the patient.",0
"Care must be taken to  promote proper bladder compliance and renal function, as well as to monitor and treat the significant lung underdevelopment that can accompany the disorder.",0
Definitive treatment may also be indicated for the vesico-ureteral reflux.,0
 Female homolog The female homolog to the male verumontanum from which the valves originate is the hymen.,0
"Eye black is a grease or strip applied under the eyes to reduce glare, although studies have not conclusively proven this.",0
It is a form of functional makeup.,0
"It is often used by American football, baseball and lacrosse players to purportedly mitigate the effects of bright sunlight or stadium floodlights.",0
"However, in comparison, many other nations play similar sports, such as Rugby, Australian Rules Football, Soccer/Association Football, and Cricket, under stadium floodlights or outdoors without the players wearing any eye black, adhesive eye black stickers, or other form of functional makeup.",0
"The wearing of eye black almost uniquely by American sports players appears to have more to do with aesthetics as journalist Paul Lukas, former writer for ESPN.com notes, ...let's be honest: glare, shmare.",0
"The real reason everyone loves to wear eye black is that it looks totally cool, like modern war paint...",0
" Varieties Traditional grease consists of beeswax, paraffin, and carbon black.",0
Anti-glare face strips that emulate the grease are also commonly used.,0
" History One of the earliest known instances of a player wearing eye black is baseball legend Babe Ruth, who, in or around the 1930s, used the grease in an attempt to reduce sun glare.",0
"According to Paul Lukas of ESPN.com, eye black caught on with American football player Andy Farkas.",0
He also states that the original eye black was made from the ashes of burned cork.,0
 2003 study A 2003 study by Brian DeBroff and Patricia Pahk tested whether black eye grease actually had anti-glare properties.,0
" The subjects of the study were divided into three groups: wearers of eye black, wearers of anti-glare stickers, and wearers of petroleum jelly.",0
The subjects' vision was tested using an eye chart while being exposed to natural sunlight.,0
"The study concluded that eye black reduced glare of the sun and improved contrast sensitivity, whereas commercial anti-glare stickers and petroleum jelly (the control substance) were found to be ineffective.However, the study was subject to unavoidable demand bias, wherein the test subjects could have unconsciously changed their responses during testing based on the fact that they knew which substance they were wearing.",0
"Also, the petroleum jelly could have introduced glare that would not occur on natural skin and the study did not test a control condition of natural skin.",0
Learning bias is also a factor in the results due to chart repetition.,0
 New Hampshire study A study by Benjamin R.,0
"Powers at University of New Hampshire, which improved on DeBroff's methodology, found eye black to reduce glare from the sun in women and in those whose eye-color was not blue.",0
The study also tested males and blue-eyed subjects.,0
"However, the results were not statistically significant (probably due to a smaller sample size of those test subjects).",0
Some testing was also performed indoors under artificial lighting (when inclement weather prohibited outdoor testing).,0
"However, those results showed little difference and were not statistically significant.",0
The Powers study was not a double-blind study because those in contact with the test subjects knew which substance was applied.,0
"Also, the eye tests were performed at a distance of only 1.15 metres (3 ft 9 in).",0
" MythBusters test On an episode of MythBusters, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman tested whether eye black reduces glare.",0
"They determined that, while eye black does not eliminate glare, it does improve an athlete's ability to differentiate between light and dark, enhancing a player's ability to track moving objects in a sunny environment.",0
" Messages in eye black Some athletes, particularly at the college level, began a practice of writing short messages on their adhesive eye black stickers.",0
"The trend gained traction among football players in the mid-2000s, popularized by Reggie Bush, who featured homages to his hometown; other popular messages included Bible verses, memorial tributes, and licensed university logos.",0
"The displays began to garner widespread media attention surrounding Tim Tebow, who used Bible verse references.",0
"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD or PCKD, also known as polycystic kidney syndrome) is a genetic disorder in which the renal tubules become structurally abnormal, resulting in the development and growth of multiple cysts within the kidney.",0
"These cysts may begin to develop in utero, in infancy, in childhood, or in adulthood.",0
"Cysts are non-functioning tubules filled with fluid pumped into them, which range in size from microscopic to enormous, crushing adjacent normal tubules and eventually rendering them non-functional as well.",0
PKD is caused by abnormal genes that produce a specific abnormal protein; this protein has an adverse effect on tubule development.,0
"PKD is a general term for two types, each having their own pathology and  genetic cause: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).",0
"The abnormal gene exists in all cells in the body; as a result, cysts may occur in the liver, seminal vesicles, and pancreas.",0
"This genetic defect can also cause aortic root aneurysms, and aneurysms in the circle of Willis cerebral arteries, which if they rupture, can cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage.",0
"Diagnosis may be suspected from one, some, or all of the following: new onset flank pain or red urine; a positive family history; palpation of enlarged kidneys on physical exam; an incidental finding on abdominal sonogram; or an incidental finding of abnormal kidney function on routine lab work (BUN, serum creatinine, or eGFR).",0
Definitive diagnosis is made by abdominal CT exam.,0
"Complications include hypertension due to the activation of the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system (RAAS), frequent cyst infections, urinary bleeding, and declining renal function.",0
Hypertension is treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).,0
Infections are treated with antibiotics.,0
Declining renal function is treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT): dialysis and/or transplantation.,0
 Management from the time of the suspected or definitive diagnosis is by a board-certified nephrologist.,0
" Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination.",0
"Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs).",0
 Cause PKD is caused by abnormal genes which produce a specific abnormal protein which has an adverse effect on tubule development.,0
 Autosomal dominant Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common of all the inherited cystic kidney diseases with an incidence of 1:500 live births.,0
Studies show that 10% of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients being treated with dialysis in Europe and the U.S.,0
"were initially diagnosed and treated for ADPKD.Genetic mutations in any of the three genes PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 have similar phenotypical presentations.",0
" Gene PKD1 is located on chromosome 16 and codes for a protein involved in regulation of cell cycle and intracellular calcium transport in epithelial cells, and is responsible for 85% of the cases of ADPKD.",0
"A group of voltage-linked cation channels, with inward selectivity for K>Na>>Ca and outward selectivity for Ca2+‚Äâ‚âà‚ÄâBa2+‚Äâ>‚ÄâNa+‚Äâ‚âà K+, are coded for by PKD2 on chromosome 4 PKD3 recently appeared in research papers as a postulated third gene.",0
Fewer than 10% of cases of ADPKD appear in non-ADPKD families.,0
"Cyst formation begins in utero from any point along the nephron, although fewer than 5% of nephrons are thought to be involved.",0
"As the cysts accumulate fluid, they enlarge, separate entirely from the nephron, compress the neighboring kidney parenchyma, and progressively compromise kidney function.",0
" Autosomal recessive Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) (OMIM #263200) is the lesser common of the two types of PKD, with an incidence of 1:20,000 live births and is typically identified in the first few weeks after birth.",0
"Unfortunately, the kidneys are often underdeveloped resulting in a 30% death rate in newborns with ARPKD.",0
PKHD1 is involved.,0
 Mechanism Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease cyst formation are tied to abnormal cilia-mediated signaling.,0
The polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 proteins appear to be involved in both autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney disease due to defects in both proteins.,0
"Both proteins have communication with calcium channel proteins, and causes reduction in resting (intracellular) calcium and endoplasmic reticulum storage of calcium.The disease is characterized by a ‚Äòsecond hit‚Äô phenomenon, in which a mutated dominant allele is inherited from a parent, with cyst formation occurring only after the normal, wild-type gene sustains a subsequent second genetic ‚Äòhit‚Äô, resulting in renal tubular cyst formation and disease progression.PKD results from defects in the primary cilium, an immotile, hair-like cellular organelle present on the surface of most cells in the body, anchored in the cell body by the basal body.",0
"In the kidney, primary cilia have been found to be present on most cells of the nephron, projecting from the apical surface of the renal epithelium into the tubule lumen.",0
"The cilia were believed to bend in the urine flow, leading to changes in signalling, however this has since been shown to be an experimental error (the bending of cilia was an artifact of focal plane compensation, and also the actual effect on micturition by severe hypertension and cardiac arrest) and that bending of cilia does not contribute to alterations in Ca flux.",0
"While it is not known how defects in the primary cilium lead to cyst development, it is thought to possibly be related to disruption of one of the many signaling pathways regulated by the primary cilium, including intracellular calcium, Wnt/Œ≤-catenin, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), or planar cell polarity (PCP).",0
"Function of the primary cilium is impaired, resulting in disruption of a number of intracellular signaling cascades which produce differentiation of cystic epithelium, increased cell division, increased apoptosis, and loss of resorptive capacity.",0
" Diagnosis Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area.",0
"A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure Natural history Most cases progress to bilateral disease in adulthood.",0
 Treatment There is no FDA-approved treatment.,0
"However, recent research indicates that mild to moderate dietary restrictions slow the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in mice.If and when the disease progresses enough in a given case, the nephrologist or other practitioner and the patient will have to decide what form of renal replacement therapy will be used to treat end-stage kidney disease (kidney failure, typically stage 4 or 5 of chronic kidney disease).That will either be some form of dialysis, which can be done at least two different ways at varying frequencies and durations (whether it is done at home or in the clinic depends on the method used and the patient's stability and training) and eventually, if they are eligible because of the nature and severity of their condition and if a suitable match can be found, unilateral or bilateral kidney transplantation.A Cochrane Review study of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease made note of the fact that it is important at all times, while avoiding antibiotic resistance, to control infections of the cysts in the kidneys, and if affected, the liver, when needed for a certain duration to combat infection, by using, bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal drugs.",0
" Prognosis ADPKD individuals might have a normal life; conversely, ARPKD can cause kidney dysfunction and can lead to kidney failure by the age of 40‚Äì60.",0
"ADPKD1 and ADPKD2 are very different, in that ADPKD2 is much milder.Currently, there are no therapies proven effective to prevent the progression of ADPKD.",0
" Epidemiology PKD is one of the most common hereditary diseases in the United States, affecting more than 600,000 people.",0
It is the cause of nearly 10% of all end-stage renal disease.,0
"It equally affects men, women, and all races.",0
PKD occurs in some animals as well as humans.,0
"Dermatitis, also known as eczema, is a group of diseases that result in inflammation of the skin.",0
"These diseases are characterized by itchiness, red skin and a rash.",0
"In cases of short duration, there may be small blisters, while in long-term cases the skin may become thickened.",0
"The area of skin involved can vary from small to covering the entire body.Dermatitis includes atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and stasis dermatitis.",0
The exact cause of the condition is often unclear.,0
"Cases may involve a combination of irritation, allergy and poor venous return.",0
The type of dermatitis is generally determined by the person's history and the location of the rash.,0
"For example, irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of those who frequently get them wet.",0
"Allergic contact dermatitis occurs upon exposure to an allergen, causing a hypersensitivity reaction in the skin.Treatment of atopic dermatitis is typically with moisturizers and steroid creams.",0
"The steroid creams should generally be of mid- to high strength and used for less than two weeks at a time, as side effects can occur.",0
Antibiotics may be required if there are signs of skin infection.,0
Contact dermatitis is typically treated by avoiding the allergen or irritant.,0
Antihistamines may help with sleep and decrease nighttime scratching.Dermatitis was estimated to affect 245 million people globally in 2015.,0
Atopic dermatitis is the most common type and generally starts in childhood.,0
"In the United States, it affects about 10‚Äì30% of people.",0
Contact dermatitis is twice as common in females than males.,0
Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 7% of people at some point in their lives.,0
"Irritant contact dermatitis is common, especially among people with certain occupations; exact rates are unclear.",0
 Signs and symptoms Dermatitis symptoms vary with all different forms of the condition.,0
They range from skin rashes to bumpy rashes or including blisters.,0
"Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring.",0
"Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle.",0
"Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin.",0
"More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.",0
Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go.,0
Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.,0
"Although the symptoms of atopic dermatitis vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin.",0
"Typical affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face and hands.",0
"Perioral dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth.Dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms include itching, stinging and a burning sensation.",0
Papules and vesicles are commonly present.,0
"The small red bumps experienced in this type of dermatitis are usually about 1 cm in size, red in color and may be found symmetrically grouped or distributed on the upper or lower back, buttocks, elbows, knees, neck, shoulders, and scalp.",0
"Less frequently, the rash may appear inside the mouth or near the hairline.",0
"The symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis, on the other hand, tend to appear gradually, from dry or greasy scaling of the scalp (dandruff) to scaling of facial areas, sometimes with itching, but without hair loss.",0
" In newborns, the condition causes a thick and yellowish scalp rash, often accompanied by a diaper rash.",0
"In severe cases, symptoms may appear along the hairline, behind the ears, on the eyebrows, on the bridge of the nose, around the nose, on the chest, and on the upper back.",0
" Environmental The hygiene hypothesis postulates that the cause of asthma, eczema, and other allergic diseases is an unusually clean environment in childhood which leads to an insufficient human microbiota.",0
It is supported by epidemiologic studies for asthma.,0
"The hypothesis states that exposure to bacteria and other immune system modulators is important during development, and missing out on this exposure increases the risk for asthma and allergy.",0
"While it has been suggested that eczema may sometimes be an allergic reaction to the excrement from house dust mites, with up to 5% of people showing antibodies to the mites, the overall role this plays awaits further corroboration.",0
" Genetic A number of genes have been associated with eczema, one of which is filaggrin.",0
"Genome-wide studies found three new genetic variants associated with eczema: OVOL1, ACTL9 and IL4-KIF3A.Eczema occurs about three times more frequently in individuals with celiac disease and about two times more frequently in relatives of those with celiac disease, potentially indicating a genetic link between the conditions.",0
 Pathophysiology Eczema can be characterized by spongiosis which allows inflammatory mediators to accumulate.,0
"Different dendritic cells sub types, such as Langerhans cells, inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells have a role to play.",0
 Diagnosis Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination.,0
"In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis.",0
Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.Patch tests are used in the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis.,0
 Classification The term eczema refers to a set of clinical characteristics.,0
"Classification of the underlying diseases has been haphazard with numerous different classification systems, and many synonyms being used to describe the same condition.",0
"A type of dermatitis may be described by location (e.g., hand eczema), by specific appearance (eczema craquele or discoid) or by possible cause (varicose eczema).",0
"Further adding to the confusion, many sources use the term eczema interchangeably for the most common type: atopic dermatitis.",0
"The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) published a position paper in 2001, which simplifies the nomenclature of allergy-related diseases, including atopic and allergic contact eczemas.",0
Non-allergic eczemas are not affected by this proposal.,0
" Histopathologic classification By histopathology, superficial dermatitis (in the epidermis, papillary dermis, and superficial vascular plexus) can basically be classified into either of the following groups: Vesiculobullous lesions Pustular dermatosis Non vesicullobullous, non-pustularWith epidermal changes Without epidermal changes.",0
"These characteristically have a superficial perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, and can be classified by type of cell infiltrate:Lymphocytic (most common) Lymphoeosinophilic Lymphoplasmacytic Mast cell Lymphohistiocytic Neutrophilic Terminology There are several types of dermatitis including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis and seborrheic eczema.",0
Many use the term dermatitis and eczema synonymously.Others use the term eczema to specifically mean atopic dermatitis.,0
Atopic dermatitis is also known as atopic eczema.,0
"In some languages, dermatitis and eczema mean the same thing, while in other languages dermatitis implies an acute condition and eczema a chronic one.",0
 Common types Diagnosis of types may be indicated by codes defined according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD).,0
 Atopic Atopic dermatitis is an allergic disease believed to have a hereditary component and often runs in families whose members have asthma.,0
"Itchy rash is particularly noticeable on head and scalp, neck, inside of elbows, behind knees, and buttocks.",0
It is very common in developed countries and rising.,0
Irritant contact dermatitis is sometimes misdiagnosed as atopic dermatitis.,0
Stress can cause atopic dermatitis to worsen.,0
" Contact Contact dermatitis is of two types: allergic (resulting from a delayed reaction to an allergen, such as poison ivy, nickel, or Balsam of Peru), and irritant (resulting from direct reaction to a detergent, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, for example).",0
"Some substances act both as allergen and irritant (wet cement, for example).",0
"Other substances cause a problem after sunlight exposure, bringing on phototoxic dermatitis.",0
"About three quarters of cases of contact eczema are of the irritant type, which is the most common occupational skin disease.",0
"Contact eczema is curable, provided the offending substance can be avoided and its traces removed from one's environment.",0
(ICD-10 L23; L24; L56.1; L56.0) Seborrhoeic Seborrhoeic dermatitis or seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap in infants) is a condition sometimes classified as a form of eczema that is closely related to dandruff.,0
"It causes dry or greasy peeling of the scalp, eyebrows, and face, and sometimes trunk.",0
"In newborns, it causes a thick, yellow, crusty scalp rash called cradle cap, which seems related to lack of biotin and is often curable.",0
"(ICD-10 L21; L21.0) Less common types Dyshidrosis Dyshidrosis (dyshidrotic eczema, pompholyx, vesicular palmoplantar dermatitis) only occurs on palms, soles, and sides of fingers and toes.",0
"Tiny opaque bumps called vesicles, thickening, and cracks are accompanied by itching, which gets worse at night.",0
"A common type of hand eczema, it worsens in warm weather.",0
"(ICD-10 L30.1) Discoid Discoid eczema (nummular eczema, exudative eczema, microbial eczema) is characterized by round spots of oozing or dry rash, with clear boundaries, often on lower legs.",0
It is usually worse in winter.,0
"Cause is unknown, and the condition tends to come and go.",0
"(ICD-10 L30.0) Venous Venous eczema (gravitational eczema, stasis dermatitis, varicose eczema) occurs in people with impaired circulation, varicose veins, and edema, and is particularly common in the ankle area of people over 50.",0
"There is redness, scaling, darkening of the skin, and itching.",0
The disorder predisposes to leg ulcers.,0
"(ICD-10 I83.1) Herpetiformis Dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease) causes an intensely itchy and typically symmetrical rash on arms, thighs, knees, and back.",0
"It is directly related to celiac disease, can often be put into remission with an appropriate diet, and tends to get worse at night.",0
"(ICD-10 L13.0) Neurodermatitis Neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus, localized scratch dermatitis) is an itchy area of thickened, pigmented eczema patch that results from habitual rubbing and scratching.",0
"Usually, there is only one spot.",0
Often curable through behaviour modification and anti-inflammatory medication.,0
Prurigo nodularis is a related disorder showing multiple lumps.,0
"(ICD-10 L28.0; L28.1) Autoeczematization Autoeczematization (id reaction, auto sensitization) is an eczematous reaction to an infection with parasites, fungi, bacteria, or viruses.",0
It is completely curable with the clearance of the original infection that caused it.,0
The appearance varies depending on the cause.,0
It always occurs some distance away from the original infection.,0
"(ICD-10 L30.2) Viral There are eczemas overlaid by viral infections (eczema herpeticum or vaccinatum), and eczemas resulting from underlying disease (e.g., lymphoma).",0
"Eczemas originating from ingestion of medications, foods, and chemicals, have not yet been clearly systematized.",0
Other rare eczematous disorders exist in addition to those listed here.,0
 Prevention Only breastfeeding during at least the first few months may decrease the risk.,0
There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk.,0
Nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.,0
There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.Certain military and healthcare personnel who might come into contact with the smallpox are still vaccinated against the virus.,0
"Those who also have eczema should not receive the smallpox vaccination due to risk of developing eczema vaccinatum, a potentially severe and sometimes fatal complication.",0
" Management There is no known cure for some types of dermatitis, with treatment aiming to control symptoms by reducing inflammation and relieving itching.",0
Contact dermatitis is treated by avoiding what is causing it.,0
" Lifestyle Bathing once or more a day is recommended, usually for five to ten minutes in warm water.",0
Soaps should be avoided as they tend to strip the skin of natural oils and lead to excessive dryness.,0
The American Academy of Dermatology suggests using a controlled amount of bleach diluted in a bath to help with atopic dermatitis.There has not been adequate evaluation of changing the diet to reduce eczema.,0
There is some evidence that infants with an established egg allergy may have a reduction in symptoms if eggs are eliminated from their diets.,0
"Benefits have not been shown for other elimination diets, though the studies are small and poorly executed.",0
"Establishing that there is a food allergy before dietary change could avoid unnecessary lifestyle changes.People can wear clothing designed to manage the itching, scratching and peeling.House dust mite reduction and avoidance measures have been studied in low quality trials and have not shown evidence of improving eczema.",0
 Moisturizers Low-quality evidence indicates that moisturizing agents (emollients) may reduce eczema severity and lead to fewer flares.,0
"In children, oil‚Äìbased formulations appear to be better and water‚Äìbased formulations are not recommended.",0
It is unclear if moisturizers that contain ceramides are more or less effective than others.,0
"Products that contain dyes, perfumes, or peanuts should not be used.",0
"Occlusive dressings at night may be useful.Some moisturizers or barrier creams may reduce irritation in occupational irritant hand dermatitis, a skin disease that can affect people in jobs that regularly come into contact with water, detergents, chemicals or other irritants.",0
Some emollients may reduce the number of flares in people with dermatitis.,0
" Medications Corticosteroids If symptoms are well controlled with moisturizers, steroids may only be required when flares occur.",0
Corticosteroids are effective in controlling and suppressing symptoms in most cases.,0
Once daily use is generally enough.,0
"For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g., hydrocortisone), while in more severe cases a higher-potency steroid (e.g., clobetasol propionate) may be used.",0
"In severe cases, oral or injectable corticosteroids may be used.",0
"While these usually bring about rapid improvements, they have greater side effects.",0
"Long term use of topical steroids may result in skin atrophy, stria, telangiectasia.",0
Their use on delicate skin (face or groin) is therefore typically with caution.,0
"They are, however, generally well tolerated.",0
"Red burning skin, where the skin turns red upon stopping steroid use, has been reported among adults who use topical steroids at least daily for more than a year.",0
 Antihistamines There is little evidence supporting the efficacy of antihistamine for the relief of dermatitis.,0
"Sedative antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, may be useful in those who are unable to sleep due to eczema.",0
Second generation antihistamines have minimal evidence of benefit.,0
"Of the second generation antihistamines studied, fexofenadine is the only one to show evidence of improvement in itching with minimal side effects.",0
 Immunosuppressants Topical immunosuppressants like pimecrolimus and tacrolimus may be better in the short term and appear equal to steroids after a year of use.,0
Their use is reasonable in those who do not respond to or are not tolerant of steroids.,0
Treatments are typically recommended for short or fixed periods of time rather than indefinitely.,0
"Tacrolimus 0.1% has generally proved more effective than pimecrolimus, and equal in effect to mid-potency topical steroids.",0
"There is no link to increased risk of cancer from topical use of 1% pimecrolimus cream.When eczema is severe and does not respond to other forms of treatment, systemic immunosuppressants are sometimes used.",0
Immunosuppressants can cause significant side effects and some require regular blood tests.,0
"The most commonly used are ciclosporin, azathioprine, and methotrexate.",0
 Light therapy Light therapy using ultraviolet light has tentative support but the quality of the evidence is not very good.,0
"A number of different types of light may be used including UVA and UVB; in some forms of treatment, light sensitive chemicals such as psoralen are also used.",0
"Overexposure to ultraviolet light carries its own risks, particularly that of skin cancer.",0
 Alternative medicine Limited evidence suggests that acupuncture may reduce itching in those affected by atopic dermatitis.,0
There is currently no scientific evidence for the claim that sulfur treatment relieves eczema.,0
It is unclear whether Chinese herbs help or harm.,0
Dietary supplements are commonly used by people with eczema.,0
Neither evening primrose oil nor borage seed oil taken orally have been shown to be effective.,0
Both are associated with gastrointestinal upset.,0
Probiotics are likely to make little to no difference in symptoms.,0
"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of zinc, selenium, vitamin D, vitamin E, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), sea buckthorn oil, hempseed oil, sunflower oil, or fish oil as dietary supplements.Chiropractic spinal manipulation lacks evidence to support its use for dermatitis.",0
There is little evidence supporting the use of psychological treatments.,0
While dilute bleach baths have been used for infected dermatitis there is little evidence for this practice.,0
 Prognosis Most cases are well managed with topical treatments and ultraviolet light.,0
About 2% of cases are not.,0
"In more than 60% of young children, the condition subsides by adolescence.",0
 Epidemiology Globally dermatitis affected approximately 230 million people as of 2010 (3.5% of the population).,0
"Dermatitis is most commonly seen in infancy, with female predominance of eczema presentations occurring during the reproductive period of 15‚Äì49 years.",0
"In the UK about 20% of children have the condition, while in the United States about 10% are affected.Although little data on the rates of eczema over time exists prior to the 1940s, the rate of eczema has been found to have increased substantially in the latter half of the 20th century, with eczema in school-aged children being found to increase between the late 1940s and 2000.",0
In the developed world there has been rise in the rate of eczema over time.,0
 The incidence and lifetime prevalence of eczema in England has been seen to increase in recent times.Dermatitis affected about 10% of U.S.,0
"workers in 2010, representing over 15 million workers with dermatitis.",0
"Prevalence rates were higher among females than among males, and among those with some college education or a college degree compared to those with a high school diploma or less.",0
"Workers employed in healthcare and social assistance industries and life, physical, and social science occupations had the highest rates of reported dermatitis.",0
About 6% of dermatitis cases among U.S.,0
"workers were attributed to work by a healthcare professional, indicating that the prevalence rate of work-related dermatitis among workers was at least 0.6%.",0
"Telangiectasias, also known as spider veins, are small dilated blood vessels that can occur near the surface of the skin or mucous membranes, measuring between 0.5 and 1 millimeter in diameter.",0
"These dilated blood vessels can develop anywhere on the body but are commonly seen on the face around the nose, cheeks and chin.",0
"Dilated blood vessels can also develop on the legs, although when they occur on the legs, they often have underlying venous reflux or hidden varicose veins (see Venous hypertension section below).",0
"When found on the legs, they are found specifically on the upper thigh, below the knee joint and around the ankles.",0
Many patients who suffer with spider veins seek the assistance of physicians who specialize in vein care or peripheral vascular disease.,0
These physicians are called vascular surgeons or phlebologists.,0
"More recently, interventional radiologists have started treating venous problems.",0
Some telangiectasias are due to developmental abnormalities that can closely mimic the behaviour of benign vascular neoplasms.,0
"They may be composed of abnormal aggregations of arterioles, capillaries or venules.",0
"Because telangiectasias are vascular lesions, they blanch when tested with diascopy.",0
"Telangiectasias, aside from presenting in many other conditions, are one of the features of the acronymically named CREST syndrome, a form of systemic scleroderma.",0
"The syndrome recognises the significantly co-presenting symptoms of calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia.",0
 Causes The causes of telangiectasia can be divided into congenital and acquired factors.,0
 Genetic Goldman states that numerous inherited or congenital conditions display cutaneous telangiectasia.,0
These include:  Bloom syndrome (homozygous null mutation in BLM DNA repair enzyme.,0
"similar mechanism and etiology to ataxia telangiectasia) Naevus flammeus (port-wine stain) Klippel‚ÄìTrenaunay syndrome Maffucci syndrome (multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas) Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler‚ÄìWeber‚ÄìRendu syndrome) Ataxia‚Äìtelangiectasia Sturge‚ÄìWeber syndrome, a nevus formation in the skin supplied by the trigeminal nerve and associated with facial port-wine stains, glaucoma, meningeal angiomas and intellectual disabilities Hypotrichosis‚Äìlymphedema‚Äìtelangiectasia syndrome, caused by mutation in transcription factor SOX18 Venous hypertension In the past, it was believed that leg varicose veins or telangectasia were caused by high venous pressure or venous hypertension.",0
However it is now understood that venous reflux disease is usually the cause of these problems.Telangiectasia in the legs is often related to the presence of venous reflux within underlying varicose veins.,0
Flow abnormalities within the medium-sized veins of the leg (reticular veins) can also lead to the development of telangiectasia.,0
Factors that predispose to the development of varicose and telangiectatic leg veins include  Age Gender: It used to be thought that females were affected far more than males.,0
"However, research has shown 79% of adult males and 88% of adult females have leg telangectasia (spider veins).",0
Pregnancy: Pregnancy is a key factor contributing to the formation of varicose and spider veins.,0
The most important factor is circulating hormones that weaken vein walls.,0
"There's also a significant increase in the blood volume during pregnancy, which tends to distend veins, causing valve dysfunction which leads to blood pooling in the veins.",0
"Moreover, later in pregnancy, the enlarged uterus can compress veins, causing higher vein pressure leading to dilated veins.",0
Varicose veins that form during pregnancy may spontaneously improve or even disappear a few months after delivery.,0
Lifestyle/occupation: Those who are involved with prolonged sitting or standing in their daily activities have an increased risk of developing varicose veins.,0
"The weight of the blood continuously pressing against the closed valves causes them to fail, leading to vein distention.",0
" Other acquired causes Acquired telangiectasia, not related to other venous abnormalities, for example on the face and trunk, can be caused by factors such as  Cushing's syndrome Acne rosacea Blepharitis Environmental damage such as that caused by sun or cold exposure Age Trauma to skin such as contusions or surgical incisions.",0
"Radiation exposure such as that experienced during radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer, e.g., radiation proctitis Chemotherapy Carcinoid syndrome Limited systemic sclerosis/scleroderma (a Scleroderma sub-type) Chronic treatment with topical corticosteroids may lead to telangiectasia.",0
Spider angiomas are a radial array of tiny arterioles that commonly occur in pregnant women and in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and are associated with palmar erythema.,0
" In men, they are related to high estrogen levels secondary to liver disease.",0
"Tempi syndrome Tobacco smoking Treatment Before any treatment of leg telangectasia (spider veins) is considered, it is essential to have duplex ultrasonography, the test that has replaced Doppler ultrasound.",0
The reason for this is that there is a clear association between leg telangectasia (spider veins) and underlying venous reflux.,0
"Research has shown that 88-89% of women with telangectasia (spider veins) have refluxing reticular veins close, and 15% have incompetent perforator veins nearby.",0
"As such, it is essential to both find and treat underlying venous reflux before considering any treatment at all.",0
Sclerotherapy is the gold standard and is preferred over laser for eliminating telangiectasiae and smaller varicose leg veins.,0
A sclerosant medication is injected into the diseased vein so it hardens and eventually shrinks away.,0
"Recent evidence with foam sclerotherapy shows that the foam containing the irritating sclerosant quickly appears in the patient's heart and lungs, and then in some cases travels through a patent foramen ovale to the brain.",0
This has led to concerns about the safety of sclerotherapy for telangectasias and spider veins.,0
In some cases stroke and transient ischemic attacks have occurred after sclerotherapy.,0
"Varicose veins and reticular veins are often treated before treating telangiectasia, although treatment of these larger veins in advance of sclerotherapy for telangiectasia may not guarantee better results.",0
"Varicose veins can be treated with foam sclerotherapy, endovenous laser treatment, radiofrequency ablation, or open surgery.",0
" The biggest risk, however, seems to occur with sclerotherapy, especially in terms of systemic risk of DVT, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.Other issues which arise with the use of sclerotherapy to treat spider veins are staining, shadowing, telangetatic matting, and ulceration.",0
" In addition, incompleteness of therapy is common, requiring multiple treatment sessions.Telangiectasias on the face are often treated with a laser.",0
"Laser therapy uses a light beam that is pulsed onto the veins in order to seal them off, causing them to dissolve.",0
These light-based treatments require adequate heating of the veins.,0
" These treatments can result in the destruction of sweat glands, and the risk increases with the number of treatments.",0
Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which excess copper builds up in the body.,0
Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver.,0
"Liver-related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, yellowish skin and itchiness.",0
"Brain-related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety and seeing or hearing things that others do not.Wilson's disease is caused by a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene.",0
"This protein transports excess copper into bile, where it is excreted in waste products.",0
"The condition is autosomal recessive; for a person to be affected, they must inherit a mutated copy of the gene from both parents.",0
"Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests and a liver biopsy.",0
Genetic testing may be used to screen family members of those affected.Wilson's disease is typically treated with dietary changes and medication.,0
Dietary changes involve eating a low-copper diet and not using copper cookware.,0
Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements.,0
"Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer and kidney problems.",0
"A liver transplant may be helpful in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.Wilson's disease occurs in about 1 in 30,000 people.",0
Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 35 years.,0
It was first described in 1854 by German pathologist Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs and is named after British neurologist Samuel Wilson.,0
" Signs and symptoms The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis.",0
"People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, who tend to be in their twenties or older.",0
"Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.",0
" Liver disease Liver disease may present itself as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension.",0
"The latter, a condition in which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites).",0
"On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed.",0
Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms.,0
"While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.About 5% of all people are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells).",0
This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver.,0
The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream.,0
"When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).",0
 Neuropsychiatric symptoms About half the people with Wilson's disease have neurological or psychiatric symptoms.,0
"Most initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness, as well as changes in behavior.",0
"Specific neurological symptoms usually then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia or slowed movements and a lack of balance are the most common parkinsonian features) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of part of the body).",0
Seizures and migraine appear to be more common in Wilson's disease.,0
A characteristic tremor described as wing-beating tremor is encountered in many people with Wilson's; this is absent at rest but can be provoked by abducting the arms and flexing the elbows toward the midline.Cognition can also be affected in Wilson's disease.,0
"This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia).",0
"It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.Psychiatric problems due to Wilson's disease may include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis.",0
Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen in conjunction with neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own.,0
These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes.,0
"Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.",0
" Other organ systems Medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease:  Eyes: Kayser‚ÄìFleischer rings (KF rings), a pathognomonic sign, may be visible in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea.",0
They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane.,0
"These rings can be either dark brown, golden, or reddish-green, are 1 to 3 mm wide, and appear at the corneal limbus.",0
They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease.,0
Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule.,0
Neither cause significant visual loss.,0
KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).,0
"Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis (Type 2), a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the proximal tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), a weakening of bones (due to calcium and phosphate loss), and occasionally aminoaciduria (loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis).",0
Heart: cardiomyopathy (weakness of the heart muscle) is a rare but recognized problem in Wilson's disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).,0
"Hormones: hypoparathyroidism (failure of the parathyroid glands leading to low calcium levels), infertility, and recurrent miscarriage.",0
"Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin.",1
 Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar glucose to enter cells to produce energy.,1
" Different factors, including genetics and some viruses, may contribute to type 1 diabetes.",1
" Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults.",1
" Despite active research, type 1 diabetes has no cure.",1
" Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels with insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.",1
 Type 1 diabetes signs and symptoms can appear relatively suddenly and may include Increased thirst Frequent urination Bed-wetting in children who previously didnt wet the bed during the night Extreme hunger Unintended weight loss Irritability and other mood changes Fatigue and weakness Blurred vision Consult your doctor if you notice any of the above signs and symptoms in you or your child.,1
 The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown.,1
" Usually, the bodys own immune system ‚ which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses ‚ mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing islet, or islets of Langerhans cells in the pancreas.",1
" Other possible causes include Genetics Exposure to viruses and other environmental factors Once a significant number of islet cells are destroyed, youll produce little or no insulin.",1
 Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach pancreas.,1
 The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.,1
" Insulin circulates, allowing sugar to enter your cells.",1
 Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.,1
" As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.",1
 Glucose ‚ a sugar ‚ is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.,1
 Glucose comes from two major sources food and your liver.,1
" Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.",1
 Your liver stores glucose as glycogen.,1
" When your glucose levels are low, such as when you havent eaten in a while, the liver breaks down the stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose levels within a normal range.",1
" In type 1 diabetes, theres no insulin to let glucose into the cells, so sugar builds up in your bloodstream.",1
 This can cause life-threatening complications.,1
 Some known risk factors for type 1 diabetes include Family history.,1
 Anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition.,1
 Diabetes can affect your emotions both directly and indirectly.,1
" Poorly controlled blood sugar can directly affect your emotions by causing behavior changes, such as irritability.",1
 There may be times you feel resentful about your diabetes.,1
" People with diabetes have an increased risk of depression and diabetes-related distress, which may be why many diabetes specialists regularly include a social worker or psychologist as part of their diabetes care team.",1
 You may find that talking to other people with type 1 diabetes is helpful.,1
 Support groups are available both online and in person.,1
" Group members often know about the latest treatments and tend to share their own experiences or helpful information, such as where to find carbohydrate counts for your favorite takeout restaurant.",1
" If youre interested in a support group, your doctor may be able to recommend one in your area.",1
 Or you can visit the websites of the American Diabetes Association ADA or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation JDRF for support group information and to check out local activities for people with type 1 diabetes.,1
 You can also reach the ADA at 800-DIABETES 800-342-2383 or JDRF at 800-533-CURE 800-533-2873.,1
" If you suspect that you or your child might have type 1 diabetes, get evaluated immediately.",1
 A simple blood test can let your doctor know if you need further evaluation and treatment.,1
" After diagnosis, youll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar level stabilizes.",1
 A doctor who specializes in hormonal disorders endocrinologist generally coordinates diabetes care.,1
" Your health care team will likely include Certified diabetes educator Dietitian Social worker or mental health professional Pharmacist Dentist Certified diabetes educator Doctor who specializes in eye care ophthalmologist Doctor who specializes in foot health podiatrist Once youve learned the basics of managing type 1 diabetes, your endocrinologist likely will recommend checkups every few months.",1
" A thorough yearly exam and regular foot and eye exams also are important ‚ especially if youre having a hard time managing your diabetes, if you have high blood pressure or kidney disease, or if youre pregnant.",1
 These tips can help you prepare for your appointments and know what to expect from your doctor.,1
 Write down any questions you have as they occur.,1
" Once you begin insulin treatment, the initial symptoms of diabetes should go away.",1
" However, you may have new issues that you need to address, such as recurring low blood sugar episodes or how to address high blood sugar after eating certain foods.",1
" Write down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.",1
" Many factors can affect your diabetes control, including stress.",1
" Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements youre taking.",1
" For your regular checkups, bring a book with your recorded glucose values or your meter to your appointments.",1
 Write down questions to ask your doctor.,1
 Preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time with your doctor and the rest of your health care team.,1
" For type 1 diabetes, topics you want to clarify with your doctor, dietitian or diabetes educator include The frequency and timing of blood glucose monitoring Insulin therapy types of insulin used, timing of dosing, amount of dose Insulin administration ‚ shots versus a pump Low blood sugar ‚ how to recognize and treat High blood sugar ‚ how to recognize and treat Ketones ‚ testing and treatment Nutrition ‚ types of food and their effect on blood sugar Carbohydrate counting Exercise ‚ adjusting insulin and food intake for activity Medical management ‚ how often to visit the doctor and other diabetes care specialists Sick day management Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, including How comfortable are you managing your diabetes.",1
 How frequent are your low blood sugar episodes.,1
" After 80-90% of the beta cells are destroyed, hyperglycemia develops and diabetes may be diagnosed.",1
" Patients need exogenous insulin to reverse this catabolic condition, prevent ketosis, decrease hyperglucagonemia, and normalize lipid and protein metabolism.",1
" Currently, autoimmunity is considered the major factor in the pathophysiology of type 1 DM.",1
" In a genetically susceptible individual, viral infection may stimulate the production of antibodies against a viral protein that trigger an autoimmune response against antigenically similar beta cell molecules.",1
" Approximately 85% of type 1 DM patients have circulating islet cell antibodies, and the majority also have detectable anti-insulin antibodies before receiving insulin therapy.",1
" The most commonly found islet cell antibodies are those directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD, an enzyme found within pancreatic beta cells.",1
" The prevalence of type 1 DM is increased in patients with other autoimmune diseases, such as Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and Addison disease.",1
 Pilia et al found a higher prevalence of islet cell antibodies IA2 and anti-GAD antibodies in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis.,1
" A study by Philippe et al used computed tomography CT scans, glucagon stimulation test results, and fecal elastase-1 measurements to confirm reduced pancreatic volume in individuals with DM.",1
" This finding, which was equally present in both type 1 and type 2 DM, may also explain the associated exocrine dysfunction that occurs in DM.",1
 Polymorphisms of the class II human leukocyte antigen HLA genes that encode DR and DQ are the major genetic determinants of type 1 DM.,1
 Approximately 95% of patients with type 1 DM have either HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4.,1
 Heterozygotes for those haplotypes are at significantly greater risk for DM than homozygotes.,1
 HLA-DQs are also considered specific markers of type 1 DM susceptibility.,1
" In contrast, some haplotypes eg, HLA-DR2 confer strong protection against type 1 DM.",1
 Sensory and autonomic neuropathy in people with diabetes are caused by axonal degeneration and segmental demyelination.,1
" Many factors are involved, including the accumulation of sorbitol in peripheral sensory nerves from sustained hyperglycemia.",1
 Motor neuropathy and cranial mononeuropathy result from vascular disease in blood vessels supplying nerves.,1
" Using nailfold video capillaroscopy, Barchetta et al detected a high prevalence of capillary changes in patients with diabetes, particularly those with retinal damage.",1
 This reflects a generalized microvessel involvement in both type 1 and type 2 DM.,1
 Microvascular disease causes multiple pathologic complications in people with diabetes.,1
" Hyaline arteriosclerosis, a characteristic pattern of wall thickening of small arterioles and capillaries, is widespread and is responsible for ischemic changes in the kidney, retina, brain, and peripheral nerves.",1
 Atherosclerosis of the main renal arteries and their intrarenal branches causes chronic nephron ischemia.,1
 It is a significant component of multiple renal lesions in diabetes.,1
 Vitamin D deficiency is an important independent predictor of development of coronary artery calcification in individuals with type 1 DM.,1
 Joergensen et al determined that vitamin D deficiency in type 1 diabetes may predict all causes of mortality but not development of microvascular complications.,1
" In the kidneys, the characteristic wall thickening of small arterioles and capillaries leads to diabetic nephropathy, which is characterized by proteinuria, glomerular hyalinization Kimmelstiel-Wilson, and chronic renal failure.",1
" Exacerbated expression of cytokines such as tumor growth factor beta 1 is part of the pathophysiology of glomerulosclerosis, which begins early in the course of diabetic nephropathy.",1
 Genetic factors influence the development of diabetic nephropathy.,1
 Single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting the factors involved in its pathogenesis appear to influence the risk for diabetic nephropathy in different people with type 1 DM.,1
" In areas where rates of type 2 DM and obesity are high, individuals with type 1 DM may share genetic and environmental factors that lead to their exhibiting type 2 features such as reduced insulin sensitivity.",1
 This condition is termed double diabetes.,1
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar glucose ‚ an important source of fuel for your body.,1
"With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin ‚ a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells ‚ or doesnt produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.",1
"Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but today more children are being diagnosed with the disorder, probably due to the rise in childhood obesity.",1
"Theres no cure for type 2 diabetes, but losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease.",1
"If diet and exercise arent enough to manage your blood sugar well, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy.",1
Signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly.,1
"In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it.",1
"Look for Increased thirst Frequent urination Increased hunger Unintended weight loss Fatigue Blurred vision Slow-healing sores Frequent infections Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck See your doctor if you notice type 2 diabetes symptoms.",1
Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin.,1
"Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as being overweight and inactive, seem to be contributing factors.",1
Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach pancreas.,1
The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.,1
"The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.",1
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.,1
"As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.",1
Glucose ‚ a sugar ‚ is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.,1
Glucose comes from two major sources food and your liver.,1
"Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.",1
Your liver stores and makes glucose.,1
"When your glucose levels are low, such as when you havent eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range.",1
"In type 2 diabetes, this process doesnt work well.",1
"Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.",1
"As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and cant make enough insulin to meet the bodys demands.",1
"In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin.",1
Factors that may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes include Weight.,1
 Being overweight is a main risk factor for type 2 diabetes.,1
"However, you dont have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes.",1
"To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits.",1
"Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem.",1
Avoiding being sedentary for long periods.,1
 Sitting still for long periods can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes.,1
Try to get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes.,1
Sometimes medication is an option as well.,1
"Metformin Glucophage, Glumetza, others, an oral diabetes medication, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.",1
"But even if you take medication, healthy lifestyle choices remain essential for preventing or managing diabetes.",1
"Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like theyve never experienced.",1
See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.,1
Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed using the Glycated hemoglobin A1C test.,1
 This blood test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months.,1
"Normal levels are below 5.7 percent, and a result between 5.7 and 6.4 percent is considered prediabetes.",1
An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests means you have diabetes.,1
"If the A1C test isnt available, or if you have certain conditions ‚ such as an uncommon form of hemoglobin known as a hemoglobin variant ‚ that interfere with A1C test, your doctor may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes Random blood sugar test.",1
 Blood sugar values are expressed in milligrams per deciliter mg/dL or millimoles per liter mmol/L.,1
"Regardless of when you last ate, a blood sample showing that your blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL 11.1 mmol/L or higher suggests diabetes, especially if you also have signs and symptoms of diabetes, such as frequent urination and extreme thirst.",1
Fasting blood sugar test.,1
 A blood sample is taken after an overnight fast.,1
A reading of less than 100 mg/dL 5.6 mmol/L is normal.,1
A level from 100 to 125 mg/dL 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L is considered prediabetes.,1
"If your fasting blood sugar is 126 mg/dL 7 mmol/L or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.",1
Oral glucose tolerance test.,1
" This test is less commonly used than the others, except during pregnancy.",1
Youll need to fast overnight and then drink a sugary liquid at the doctors office.,1
Blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours.,1
A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL 7.8 mmol/L is normal.,1
A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL 7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L indicates prediabetes.,1
A reading of 200 mg/dL 11.1 mmol/L or higher after two hours suggests diabetes.,1
"The American Diabetes Association recommends routine screening for type 2 diabetes beginning at age 45, especially if youre overweight.",1
"If the results are normal, repeat the test every three years.",1
"If the results are borderline, ask your doctor when to come back for another test.",1
"Screening is also recommended for people who are under 45 and overweight if there are other heart disease or diabetes risk factors present, such as a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of type 2 diabetes, a personal history of gestational diabetes or blood pressure above 140/90 millimeters of mercury mm Hg.",1
"If youre diagnosed with diabetes, the doctor may do other tests to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes ‚ since the two conditions often require different treatments.",1
A1C levels need to be checked between two and four times a year.,1
"Discuss your target A1C goal with your doctor, as it may vary depending on your age and other factors.",1
"For most people, the American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C level below 7 percent.",1
"An elevated A1C level may signal the need for a change in your medication, meal plan or activity level.",1
"In addition to the A1C test, your doctor will measure your blood pressure and take blood and urine samples periodically to check your cholesterol levels, thyroid function, liver function and kidney function.",1
Regular eye and foot exams also are important.,1
"Management of type 2 diabetes includes Weight loss Healthy eating Regular exercise Possibly, diabetes medication or insulin therapy Blood sugar monitoring These steps will help keep your blood sugar level closer to normal, which can delay or prevent complications.",1
Losing weight can lower your blood sugar levels.,1
"Losing just 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can make a difference, although a sustained weight loss of 7 percent or more of your initial weight seems to be ideal.",1
That means someone who weighs 180 pounds 82 kilograms would need to lose a little less than 13 pounds 5.9 kilograms to make an impact on blood sugar levels.,1
Controlling portions and eating healthy foods are simple ways to start taking weight off.,1
"Contrary to popular perception, theres no specific diabetes diet.",1
"However, its important to center your diet around Fewer calories Fewer refined carbohydrates, especially sweets Fewer foods containing saturated fats More vegetables and fruits More foods with fiber A registered dietitian can help you put together a meal plan that fits your health goals, food preferences and lifestyle.",1
He or she can also teach you how to monitor your carbohydrate intake and let you know about how many carbohydrates you need to eat with your meals and snacks to keep your blood sugar levels more stable.,1
"Everyone needs regular aerobic exercise, and people who have type 2 diabetes are no exception.",1
Get your doctors OK before starting an exercise program.,1
"Choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming and biking, so that you can make them part of your daily routine.",1
Aim for at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate or 15 to 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days of the week.,1
"A combination of exercises ‚ aerobic exercises, such as walking or dancing on most days, combined with resistance training, such as weightlifting or yoga twice a week ‚ offers more benefits than either type of exercise alone.",1
Remember that physical activity lowers blood sugar.,1
Check your blood sugar level before any activity.,1
You might need to eat a snack before exercising to help prevent low blood sugar if you take diabetes medications that lower your blood sugar.,1
"Its also important to reduce the amount of time you spend in inactive activities, such as watching TV.",1
Try to move around a bit every 30 minutes.,1
"Depending on your treatment plan, you may need to check and record your blood sugar level every now and then or, if youre on insulin, multiple times a day.",1
Ask your doctor how often he or she wants you to check your blood sugar.,1
Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range.,1
"Some people who have type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone, but many also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy.",1
"The decision about which medications are best depends on many factors, including your blood sugar level and any other health problems you have.",1
Your doctor might combine drugs from different classes to help you control your blood sugar in several different ways.,1
"Examples of possible treatments for type 2 diabetes include Metformin Glucophage, Glumetza, others.",1
" Generally, metformin is the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes.",1
It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving your bodys sensitivity to insulin so that your body uses insulin more effectively.,1
Nausea and diarrhea are possible side effects of metformin.,1
These side effects may go away as your body gets used to the medicine or if you take the medicine with a meal.,1
"If metformin and lifestyles changes arent enough to control your blood sugar level, other oral or injected medications can be added.",1
Sulfonylureas.,1
 These medications help your body secrete more insulin.,1
"Examples include glyburide DiaBeta, Glynase, glipizide Glucotrol and glimepiride Amaryl.",1
Possible side effects include low blood sugar and weight gain.,1
Meglitinides.,1
" These medications ‚ such as repaglinide Prandin and nateglinide Starlix ‚ work like sulfonylureas by stimulating the pancreas to secrete more insulin, but theyre faster acting, and the duration of their effect in the body is shorter.",1
They also have a risk of causing low blood sugar and weight gain.,1
Thiazolidinediones.,1
" Like metformin, these medications ‚ including rosiglitazone Avandia and pioglitazone Actos ‚ make the bodys tissues more sensitive to insulin.",1
"These drugs have been linked to weight gain and other more-serious side effects, such as an increased risk of heart failure and anemia.",1
"Because of these risks, these medications generally arent first-choice treatments.",1
DPP-4 inhibitors.,1
" These medications ‚ sitagliptin Januvia, saxagliptin Onglyza and linagliptin Tradjenta ‚ help reduce blood sugar levels, but tend to have a very modest effect.",1
"They dont cause weight gain, but may cause joint pain and increase your risk of pancreatitis.",1
GLP-1 receptor agonists.,1
 These injectable medications slow digestion and help lower blood sugar levels.,1
Their use is often associated with weight loss.,1
Possible side effects include nausea and an increased risk of pancreatitis.,1
"Exenatide Byetta, Bydureon, liraglutide Victoza and semaglutide Ozempic are examples of GLP-1 receptor agonists.",1
Recent research has shown that liraglutide and semaglutide may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people at high risk of those conditions.,1
 Some people who have type 2 diabetes need insulin therapy.,1
"In the past, insulin therapy was used as a last resort, but today its often prescribed sooner because of its benefits.",1
Low blood sugar hypoglycemia is a possible side effect of insulin.,1
"Normal digestion interferes with insulin taken by mouth, so insulin must be injected.",1
"Depending on your needs, your doctor may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use throughout the day and night.",1
"There are many types of insulin, and they each work in a different way.",1
"Often, people with type 2 diabetes start using insulin with one long-acting shot at night, such as insulin glargine Lantus or insulin detemir Levemir.",1
Discuss the pros and cons of different drugs with your doctor.,1
"Together you can decide which medication is best for you after considering many factors, including costs and other aspects of your health.",1
"In addition to diabetes medications, your doctor might prescribe low-dose aspirin therapy as well as blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering medications to help prevent heart and blood vessel disease.",1
"If you have type 2 diabetes and your body mass index BMI is greater than 35, you may be a candidate for weight-loss surgery bariatric surgery.",1
"Dramatic improvements in blood sugar levels are often seen in people with type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery, depending on the procedure performed.",1
Surgeries that bypass a portion of the small intestine have more of an effect on blood sugar levels than do other weight-loss surgeries.,1
"Surgery drawbacks include its high cost and risks, including a small risk of death.",1
It also requires drastic lifestyle changes.,1
Long-term complications may include nutritional deficiencies and osteoporosis.,1
Women with type 2 diabetes may need to alter their treatment during pregnancy.,1
Many women will require insulin therapy during pregnancy.,1
"Cholesterol-lowering medications, aspirin and some blood pressure drugs cant be used during pregnancy.",1
"If you have diabetic retinopathy, it may worsen during pregnancy.",1
Visit your ophthalmologist during the first trimester of your pregnancy and at one year postpartum.,1
"Because so many factors can affect your blood sugar, problems sometimes arise that require immediate care, such as High blood sugar hyperglycemia.",1
" Lots of things can cause your blood sugar to rise, including eating too much, being sick or not taking enough glucose-lowering medication.",1
"Watch for signs and symptoms of high blood sugar ‚ frequent urination, increased thirst, dry mouth, blurred vision, fatigue and nausea ‚ and check your blood sugar if necessary.",1
Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome HHNS.,1
 This life-threatening condition includes a blood sugar reading higher than 600 mg/dL 33.3 mmol/L.,1
Your blood sugar meter may not provide an accurate reading at this level or it may just read high.,1
"HHNS can cause dry mouth, extreme thirst, drowsiness, confusion, dark urine and convulsions.",1
HHNS is caused by sky-high blood sugar that turns blood thick and syrupy.,1
"It tends to be more common in older people with type 2 diabetes, and its often preceded by an illness or infection.",1
Call your doctor or seek immediate medical care if you have signs or symptoms of this condition.,1
Increased ketones in your urine diabetic ketoacidosis.,1
" If your cells are starved for energy, your body may begin to break down fat.",1
"This produces toxic acids known as ketones, which occur more commonly in people with type 1 diabetes.",1
"Watch for thirst or a very dry mouth, frequent urination, vomiting, shortness of breath, fatigue and fruity-smelling breath, and if you notice these signs and symptoms, consult your doctor right away or seek emergency care.",1
Low blood sugar hypoglycemia.,1
" If your blood sugar level drops below your target range, its known as low blood sugar hypoglycemia.",1
"Your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons, including skipping a meal, unintentionally taking more medication than usual or getting more physical activity than normal.",1
"Watch for signs and symptoms of low blood sugar ‚ sweating, shakiness, weakness, hunger, irritability, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, heart palpitations, slurred speech, drowsiness and confusion.",1
"If you have signs or symptoms of low blood sugar, drink or eat something that will quickly raise your blood sugar level ‚ fruit juice, glucose tablets, hard candy, regular not diet soda or another source of sugar.",1
Retest your blood in 15 minutes to be sure your blood glucose levels have normalized.,1
"If they havent, treat again and retest in another 15 minutes.",1
"If you lose consciousness, a family member or close contact may need to give you an emergency injection of glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the release of sugar into the blood.",1
"Explore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.",1
Careful management of type 2 diabetes can reduce your risk of serious ‚ even life-threatening ‚ complications.,1
Consider these tips Commit to managing your diabetes.,1
 Learn all you can about type 2 diabetes.,1
Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine.,1
"Establish a relationship with a diabetes educator, and ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.",1
"In severe cases, low blood sugar may cause you to pass out.",1
Hypoglycemia can be caused by too much insulin or not enough food.,1
Exercising too vigorously or drinking too much alcohol can have the same effect.,1
"Anyone who has diabetes is at risk of a diabetic coma, but the following factors can increase the risk Insulin delivery problems.",1
" If youre on an insulin pump, you have to check your blood sugar frequently.",1
Insulin delivery can stop if the pump fails or the tubing catheter is twisted or falls out of place.,1
A lack of insulin can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.,1
"An illness, trauma or surgery.",1
" When youre sick or injured, blood sugar levels tend to rise, sometimes dramatically.",1
This may cause diabetic ketoacidosis if you have type 1 diabetes and dont increase your insulin dosage to compensate.,1
"Medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure or kidney disease, also may increase your risk of diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.",1
Poorly managed diabetes.,1
" If you dont monitor your blood sugar properly or take your medications as directed, youll have a higher risk of developing long-term complications and a diabetic coma.",1
Deliberately skipping meals or insulin.,1
"If you feel the symptoms of extremely high or low blood sugar, call 911 or your local emergency number to make sure help is on the way before you pass out.",1
"If youre with someone with diabetes who has passed out or is acting strange, possibly as if he or she has had too much alcohol, call for immediate medical help.",1
"If you have no training in diabetes care, wait for the emergency care team to arrive.",1
"If you are familiar with diabetes care, test the unconscious persons blood sugar and follow these steps If the blood sugar level is lower than 70 mg/dL 3.9 mmol/L, give the person an injection of glucagon.",1
Do not try to give fluids to drink and do not give insulin to someone with low blood sugar.,1
If the blood sugar level is above 70 mg/dL 3.9 mmol/L wait for medical help to arrive.,1
Dont give sugar to someone whose blood sugar isnt low.,1
"If you called for medical help, let the emergency care team know about the diabetes and what steps youve taken, if any.",1
Diabetes is a long-term chronic disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.,1
Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar.,1
"Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.",1
"To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy.",1
Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream.,1
Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.,1
An organ called the pancreas makes insulin.,1
"The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.",1
" People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood.",1
This is because either Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes.,1
The causes and risk factors are different for each type Type 1 diabetes is less common.,1
"It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults.",1
"In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin.",1
This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working.,1
Daily injections of insulin are needed.,1
The exact cause of the failure to make enough insulin is unknown.,1
Type 2 diabetes is more common.,1
"It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.",1
Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.,1
"With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesnt use insulin as well as it should.",1
Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.,1
"There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.",1
 Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.,1
"If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.",1
"A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including Blurry vision Excess thirst Fatigue Frequent urination Hunger Weight loss Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.",1
Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period.,1
People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.,1
"After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems.",1
"These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include Eye problems , including trouble seeing especially at night, light sensitivity, and blindness Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot Damage to nerves in the body , causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunctionKidney problems , which can lead to kidney failure Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke A urine analysis may show high blood sugar.",1
But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.,1
Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL 11.1 mmol/L.,1
"To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.",1
Blood tests Fasting blood glucose level .,1
Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is higher than 126 mg/dL 7.0 mmol/L on two different tests.,1
